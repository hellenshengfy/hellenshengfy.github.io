Archaeologists can distinguish different types of phytoliths according to their shapes. However, further anaylsis is confined by the fact that, in most cases, a specific shape of phytoliths does not correspond to a specific plant species. Therefore, the picture drawn by phytoliths could be quite vague.

Less curved tibia Compared with the chimp&amp;rsquo;s tibia, human tibia is less curved and less flexed. This is because we human beings exclusively load our tibia from an anterior/posterior direction but chimps knuckwalk quadrupedally.

As we talked before that chimps and human being evolve from common ancestor, but who can we know when latest common ancestor (LCA) lived?
The answer lies in the molecular clock. In 1960s, geneticists found that differences in some protein structures were accumulating at a near constant rate through time, which made the time estimation of LCA possible.</description></item><item><title>Anth 207x: Miocene: the age of apes</title><link>https://hellenshengfy.github.io/en/2022/11/06/anth-207x/</link><pubDate>Sun, 06 Nov 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://hellenshengfy.github.io/en/2022/11/06/anth-207x/</guid><description>Miocene (a period between 22 million years ago and 5 million years ago) is sometimes known as &amp;ldquo;The Age of Apes&amp;rdquo;.
