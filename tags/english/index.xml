A History of Archaeological Thoughts
April 27, 2023
On the birth of culture-historical archaeology The dramatic social transformation in the late nineteen centuries catalyzed the evolution and variation of archaeology ideology. Culture-historical archaeology became undoubtedly the most important method and theory among all.</description></item><item><title>Anth 207x:Is evolution is directional?</title><link>https://hellenshengfy.github.io/en/2023/03/03/anth-207xis-evolution-is-directional/</link><pubDate>Fri, 03 Mar 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://hellenshengfy.github.io/en/2023/03/03/anth-207xis-evolution-is-directional/</guid><description>I really like the edX course Anth 207x: Introduction to Human Evolution lectured by Professor Adam Van Arsdale of Wellesley College, and I took a series of notes to this course. This article is based on my notes.
By definition, evolution is “the heritable changes in a population through time”. It seems like that evolution has a direction (for example: from simple to complex), but it is NOT the case. To understand this, we need to know four basic forces of evolutionary change: mutation, gene drift, gene flow and natural selection.</description></item><item><title>Markdown Testing</title><link>https://hellenshengfy.github.io/en/2021/01/07/second-post/</link><pubDate>Thu, 07 Jan 2021 13:37:57 -0500</pubDate><guid>https://hellenshengfy.github.io/en/2021/01/07/second-post/</guid><description>See the source code of this page if you are interested.

When I first come up with these terms, I was quite confused and found it hard to distinguish one from the other. After reading the paper Human Evolution: Taxonomy and Paleobiology, I decide to write this article and introduce you these terms under new taxonomic classification system which based on molecular evidence.
First of all, let me show you the chart, to make things easier. This chart is drawn based on the taxonomy table illustrated in Human Evolution: Taxonomy and Paleobiology.</description></item></channel></rss>
