The St. Gallen Symposium is the world’s most relevant organisation and platform for cross-generational dialogue and collaboration. My paper ***Long-term Thinking: Capital for the Future*** won the **St. Gallen Wings of Excellence Award** of the 49th St. Gallen Symposium and I was invited to the conference in Switzerland in 2019.

I participated in the project led by [Mr. Sheng Pengfei](http://www.chm.fudan.edu.cn/13/ac/c11450a398252/page.htm) and [Mr. Zhang Menghan](https://hupi.fudan.edu.cn/rcdw/rc_content.jsp?urltype=news.NewsContentUrl&wbtreeid=1127&wbnewsid=2223) (Fudan University). This project aims to build a comprehensive archaeological database and seek for multidisciplinary evidence (pollen/gene/language) of possible migration in the southeast China during the Neolithic period. I am not able to share the database but I would like to share part of python code I wrote for the project to collect data from a pdf document within seconds.

> My sincere and hearty thanks go to Ms. Dong Ningning (Fudan University) and Mr. Wen Pengyong (Fudan University) , who generously share their samples to me and make this project possible. It is their suggestions and encouragement that give me much insight into the field.
