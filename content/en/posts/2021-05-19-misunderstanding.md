Thanks to Darwin’s theory of evolution, now we know the fact that human beings are not created by god. However, many people hold the view that (1) chimps are our ancestors and (2) our ancestors look like chimps. These are misunderstandings.  

Firstly, as what I wrote in my 2020-01-07 blog, Pan is the sister clay to Homos. Roughly 7 million years ago, chimps and human beings split from evolutionary tree and evolved in their own directions. Chimps are in fact our closest relatives and thus not our ancestors. 

Secondly, “the last common ancestor of humans and chimpanzees looked like a chimpanzee” is only an assumption to be verified. Recall that both chimpanzees and humans have been evolving for millions of years, it’s possible that neither of us look like our ancestors. 

Reference: Erin Wayman, “The last common ancestor of humans and chimps probably wasn’t much like either”, Science news, https://www.sciencenews.org/article/last-common-ancestor-humans-and-chimps-probably-wasnt-much-either.
