One of my colleagues asked me about my opinion on bitcoin, which reminded me of my graduation paper. Here is an excerpt from that paper, and I hope this could help you understand the postive influences of bitcoin.

# Positive Impacts of Blockchain Technology Application on Stock Market Operation System
 
## 2.1 Primary Market: Self-verification and Confirmation of Stock Rights

###  2.1.1 Public Offering
No matter what kind of listing system (approval system or registration system) a market applies, the priority of listing is to ensure that listed entities provide real financial information to the market so that investors can make right investment decisions. False information will disturb the market order, damp down investment enthusiasm and harm the interests of investors. Therefore, nowadays, in the process of listing, companies are not only required to have a counselor for listing, most commonly investment bank, but also to provide financial statements from an accounting firm and a legal verification from a law firm so as to prove the legitimacy of their business activities. 
In contrast, blockchain, an open distributed book without the third party, not only ensures a "real and reliable" market, but also allows investors to obtain information of a company's capital flow. To some extent, blockchain technology covers the business of the law firms, accounting offices, and investment banks. 
Thus, theoretically, the blockchain technology can completely replace financial intermediaries mentioned above, shorten the time cost, reduce the listing procedures, and promote the development of the securities market.

### 2.1.2 Private Offering
In the traditional de-centralized network model, the "Byzantine General" problem remains an unsolved puzzle. Just as Byzantine generals who were faced with the problems of distrust during the war thousands of years ago, the nodes in the blockchain system are also distrustful of each other. But now, a mechanism called workload proof might provide a perfect solution to it by increasing the time-cost significantly once someone wants to pass false information. In the blockchain system, each transaction initiator must provide their digital signature. In order to get it, transaction initiator should encrypt SHA-256 output with their own public key. 
For a real transaction, time costs in the process relative to their authenticity proof are quite low. However, it is a totally different picture for counterparts who want to convey false information. Their time to produce digital signatures will exceed the counterfeiting activity itself. In this way, the blockchian technology can inhibit fraud activity efficiently. Therefore, in this way, blockchian technology can be used to confirm the ownership of the stock market and exert a direct impact on equity investment, especially for private equity. 

By definition, private equity is the stock not open to the public, and its registration is particularly important. The application of blockchian technology can reduce the uncertainty of equity registration, stimulate the private equity investment and investment normativity. 
In 2015, George Osborne, British Chancellor of the Exchequer, announced that the United Kingdom would increase its investment in electronic money and blockchain technology, showing a promising future of this technology. Several years ago, company Chain.Com successfully issued shares to private investors through blockchain trading system. In January 2016, after Deloitte & Touche applied Rubix software into audition and information registration, PricewaterhouseCoopers began to set up technical team to speed up the integration and application of blockchain technology in the accounting industry.

### 2.1.3 Stock Pricing
In accordance with the current system for IPO, two stages witness the completion of a lawful inquiry: preliminary inquiry and bookbuilding. For preliminary inquiry, it is the issuer and its sponsor that determine the price range and price-earnings ratio range after at least 20 inquiries are made; afterwards, the final issue price will be set in the bookbuilding phase. 
In the first stage, in order to get a reasonable issue price range, the assessment of stock value is of great importance. In general, the intrinsic value of the stock is the present value of dividend income in the coming years:  

{{<figure src="https://hellenshengfy.github.io/bitcoin2.png">}}
  
Where V is the intrinsic value of the stock, Dt is the dividend income in year t, and i is the discount rate. Modern stock pricing methods such as portfolio theory, capital asset pricing model (CAPM) and arbitrage pricing theory (APT) are all based on this idea. 
In these models, the historical data of issuer's operating conditions, financial situation and the future development determine the theoretical value of Dt. Therefore, a reasonable pricing model requires the authenticity and accuracy of historical data. In the view of this, since blockchian technology can ensure the credibility of the data, it would be easier for the market to reflect the true value of the enterprise if this new technology is applied. 
In the second stage, a stage of bidding to set the final issue price, issuance costs and subscription costs are always taken into consideration. Bidders will bid on different prices according to their own conditions. As a result, the deviation from the true value is inevitable if issuance costs, distribution costs and subscription costs exist. But this is not an issue to worry about for blockchain system. The blockchain technology reduces the intermediaries and various costs through direct communication and quick accounting. Thus, blockchain technology can help to get reasonable stock prices and narrow the price difference between the primary and secondary market.

  ## 2.2 Secondary Market: Decentralization and Reduction in Intermediaries  
Decentralization is the biggest and the most distinguish advantage of blockchain technology. Because of distrust problem among market participants, in the traditional information interaction, the third party, security companies for example, is regarded as an information collection and distribution center to promote the transactions. 
In the blockchain system, a peer-to-peer network is established in which all nodes are equal and all information is disclosed. Various participants compete for a specific transaction accounting right through mathematical games. If this happens, intermediaries that help to promote the transactions turn out to be unnecessary. Thus, blockchain shows the benefit and possibility of reducing the intermediaries:
  
  ### 2.2.1 To Increase Settlement Speed
Blockchain technology can complete the confirmation and accounting of a transaction every 10 minutes after information broadcasting and 6 times’ node verification. And this time interval is controllable through adjustment of target number by programmer, a number to control "mining" difficulty degree and adjust the accounting speed. 
Consequently, settlement speed can become faster and faster if the target number in the blockchain system is set properly. At present, stocks are traded two days after transaction (T + 2) in the US, one day after transaction (T +1) in Shanghai Stock Exchange. But this situation can be changed totally if blockchain technology is applied, making a instant trade possible and improving the effectiveness of the market.
   
  ### 2.2.2 To Impact Brokerage Business and Third-Party Depository System
As mentioned above, the blockchain technology shows its advantage in reducing the financial markets’ dependence on the third-party intermediaries. By far, brokerage business and the third-party depository system have played an essentially role in intermediating. Brokerage business is the business of a securities company who is committed to help investors to trade and settle stocks in exchange for commission. In contrast, blockchain technology allows investors to sell and buy securities themselves and trade with their counterparts directly, which exerts a huge impact on brokerage business. 
Third-party depository system is the agreement among investors, securities companies and asset depository banks. The appointed bank, acting as an asset depositor, will open an account for the investor during the transaction to ensure the security of the assets in the account. However, the need for this system is weakened by blockchain technology too, for it requires a specific Hash value for each transaction. Therefore, just like carrying a stamp, any node of the assets can be queried and retrospected.
  
  ###  2.2.3 To Save Transaction Costs
Reduced transaction costs are always associated with the reduction in intermediaries. And it is quite easy to realize blockchain technology’s benefit in this area. Once the brokerage business and third-party depository system are weakened, a lot of manpower and resources can be saved and freed. Investors do not need to pay for the commission and asset management fees anymore. In addition, the financial market can reallocate resources saved into other parts to further improve the marginal efficiency.
  
## 2.3 Settlement: Collective Maintenance and Insurance of Real Information
The task of all miners in the blockchain system is to find a random number N, which is used to generate a 64-bit hexadecimal number that meets requirements of SHA-256 function for a particular transaction. The difficulty of this task can be adjusted by the target number set by programmers. 
At present, blockchain system requires that the hexadecimal number found by miners should be small enough. It usually starts with 17 zeros, so that transactions can be recorded every 10 minutes. Once the number is confirmed by other nodes for more than 6 times, the first node who finds it will get certain financial reward from the system. And each successful transaction will be broadcast to the whole system to ensure that all nodes are informed of new information. 
Apparently, this is exactly a realization of information equality. Meanwhile, various confirmations also guarantee the authenticity of information. If an intruder wants to alter a piece of information or falsify it, only a computing power that defeats the other nodes in the whole system can help him and make it possible. And this possibility is so small that it can be neglected.
This collective maintenance mechanism of blockchain technology takes advantage of the power of the group, making it impossible for a single individual to challenge the system so as to solve the problem of information asymmetry. And this problem is particularly serious in the Chinese stock market, where a sharp difference between ordinary investors and institutional investors leads to tons of abnormal phenomenon such as "unbeaten new shares" and "white knight". 
Therefore, the application of blockchain technology is expected to achieve information equality in the IPO and other segments of the market.
