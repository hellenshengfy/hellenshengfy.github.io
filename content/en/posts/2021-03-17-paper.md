One of my colleagues asked me about my opinion on bitcoin, which reminded me of my graduation paper. Here is an excerpt from that paper, and I hope this could help you understand what Bitcoin is and how it works.

 # Introduction of Blockchain Technology

 ## 1.1 Definition
Technically, blockchain is a distributed database that maintains an ever-growing list of ordered records called blocks. Blocks are connected with each other by cryptography method. And every block contains a timestamp and a Hash value which links it to the previous block. Once recorded by a random node (user in the system), the data in a block cannot be altered retroactively.
 ## 1.2 Terminology
  ### 1.2.1 Hash Algorithm
Hash algorithm is a one-way function, through which the encryption of a piece of information can be achieved. And this algorithm is irreversible, namely, Y can be obtained from the X through mapping, but X can not be obtained from Y in return. SHA-256 is a typical Hash algorithm. When a user inputs a piece of information of arbitrary length into SHA-256 function, he or she will get a hash output of a fixed length; if the user changes the input number slightly, the computer will show a totally different output. Because of its characteristic of irreversibility, Hash algorithm is often regarded as a perfect method to check the integrity of information and data.
   ### 1.2.2 Digital Signature 
The essence of digital signature is a process of cryptographic transformation. It is used to verify the integrity of the original data. Public key and the private key is an integral concept of digital signature. The public key is similar to an E-mail address, which goes public, while the private key, like a code, is owned by the owner only. In the process of transaction, the sender will sign on the information package with private key, and the receiver verifies information with the sender's public key. The two are complementary to each other to ensure the authenticity of transaction.
  ###  1.2.3 Proof of Work 
The proof of work is the extra work done by blockchain users, in order to prove the authenticity of the information they send. It seems to be a waste of computing power, but it actually reflects "the handicap principle", that is, when all users in a system are equal in status and lacking in confidence in each other, they have to do extra work to express their "good intentions". Therefore, proof of work is the method for all nodes to show their authenticity.
  ##  1.3 Technology
   ### 1.3.1 Transaction Order Generation
In a typical Bitcoin transaction, here we get two problems when owner 1 wants to transfer 500 dollars to payee 2. Firstly, the owner 1 wants to check the safety of money flows, that is, whether his money goes to payee 2 safely or not. Secondly, the payee 2 wants to know the source of the money, that is, whether the owner1 is the lawful owner of the money. So how does blockchain technology solve this kind of trust problem?
First of all, referring to figure A1, the transaction initiator (owner 1) needs to input Hash value H0, the amount of money and the public key of payee 2 into the system. The Hash value of the last transaction (H0) shows the source of the money, by which the public key of owner 1 can be obtained. Meanwhile, the public key of payee 2 tells the address of the beneficiary of this transaction. Then, owner 1 needs to input this information package into the SHA-256 function so as to generate another Hash value, and encrypts it by his private key.

In this case, the encrypted Hash value is the digital signature of owner 1, which verifies the authenticity of the identity of him.So far, the owner 1 has owned an information package as well as their digital signature. And what he should do next is to input them into SHA-256 function to generate the second Hash value (H1) and then transmit it to the whole system. After that, all nodes will help to confirm the deal. For payee 2, he will receive the transaction information and the Hash value H1 of the transaction the moment the owner 1 broadcasts it in the system. Then he has several things to do. Firstly, he is supposed to use his private key to decrypt the public key in the information package. Secondly, he should find the public key of owner 1 through the Hash value. After completing these two steps, now, payee 2 has all the original content of information package. Thirdly, the payee 2 needs to put the package into the SHA-256 function again to get Hash value H2. Similarly, he will get a Hash value H3 with the owner 1's public key. As long as H3 equals to H1, the credibility of the information is proved, which is determined by the one way mapping nature of the SHA-256 function.                           
   ###  1.3.2 Transaction Record
The moment the transaction is generated, it needs to be recorded accurately. Once a single transaction is broadcast to the whole network, blockchain technology ensures that all nodes are equal and have the ability to record it. And this is an important step of the system to achieve the decentralization. Therefore, a mechanism is needed to motivate every node to record the transaction and help to select a final recorder of this transaction. This mechanism is called "Mining". Through Mining, nodes compete with each other in a mathematical game to win the right of recording and rewarding. In the game, the first node who finds a certain random number set by the system needs to broadcast it to the whole network for verification. So the Mining process (mathematical competition) encourages all nodes to involve themselves in accounting, making the transaction trustworthy.
