And **I make a summary table on the features of these three sites**. Dummy varibles : 1 refers to "yes" while 0 refers to "no". For features in the middle, I assign 0.5 to them.

## Summary Table

| Name | Year | Accomplishments |
|---------|---------|---------|
| Lu Dalin | 1042-1090 |*Baogutu* |
| John Aubrey | 1626-1697 | Plan of Avebury in *Monumenta Britannica* |
| Specialization | 0 | 0 | 
| Tech | 0 | 0.5 |
| Mass production | 0 | 0 | 
  
Just as what Wang (2022) said, Daxingzhuang seems to be a mixture of Guandimiao model and Tiesanlu model. It could be an evidence of multi-level economy by then or a transition of economical development. Considering the fact that there is no saw used in Daxingzhuang, I think the second explanation is of higher possibility.

Also, I want to point out one weakness of the Formality concept in the Wang (2022): a possible ***multicollinearity*** issue here. Because Wang (2022) discussed standization, specialization and technology when technology and standardization elements have been included in the proxy variable Formality already. I mean if Formality is accepted as a proxy, then elements within it should not be discussed together with it.
