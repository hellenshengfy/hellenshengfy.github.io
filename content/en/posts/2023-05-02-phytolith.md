***Phytoliths*** is a good alternative to pollen in the paleovegetation reconstructions, especially in the conditions where pollen evidence is badly preserved. Archaeologists can distinguish different types of phytoliths according to their shapes. However, further anaylsis is confined by the fact that, in most cases, *a specific shape of phytoliths does not correspond to a specific plant species*. Therefore, the picture drawn by phytoliths could be quite vague.

From my point of view, using **supervised machine learning** to help classification may be helpful?
