My mannual book to draw archaeological map using ArcGIS based on introductory course of Dr. Li Wei (Fudan University).

The bowhead (*Balaena mysticetus*) is a marine mammal that lives in waters covered by seasnonal sea ice (preferable to 30%-50% cover) and migrates annually, making it a good proxy of floe edge oscillation. Based on this, authors use bowhead fossils discovered in various spots to indicate paleo-sea ice and they believe that the absence of fossil records represents the absence of occupation of the place. 
  
Fossils from Mâ€™Clintock Channel region, Lancaster Sound and Eastern Prince Regent Inlet, Admiralty Inlet and Environs, Navy Board Inlet and Eclipse Sound, Norwegian Bay and Jones Sound and their frequency distributions are discussed in detail:

Three patterns are detected from the chart. (Apology for the vauge figure, but the red boxes show pattern differences quite well)

(1) **Patter 1 found in large channels from the centre of the archipelago to Baffin Bay** with **a variant in Wellington Channel**:  Large populations in early Holocene (abruptly terminated) - a long interval of whale exclusion -  a middle Holocene recurrence - a late Holocene (Neoglacial) exclusion. Wellington Channel varies in the absence of early Holocene whales.
 
(2) **Pattern 2 found in smaller eastern inlets**: Exclusion of early Holocene whales - a rapid rise of local summer populations in the middle Holocene - minimal levels through the Neoglacial.
    
(3) **Pattern 3 found in the southern portion of the Gulf of Boothia, Fury and Hecla Strait, and Norwegian Bay**: Total exclusion of whales throughout the Holocene.

  
Based on the data of bowhead remains, authors manage to reconstruct paleogeography of different periods:

The sudden termination of bowhead might be explained by the change of oceanographic circulation pattern during 8.5ka -8ka as it coincided with incursion of driftwood and increased surface water salinity.
  
The middle Holocene recurrence is possibly attribute to prevalent surface winds from west to east that helps to clear sea ice. 
  
The late Holocene decline around 3ka may be related to reduced access and ice breakup caused by land uplift.
