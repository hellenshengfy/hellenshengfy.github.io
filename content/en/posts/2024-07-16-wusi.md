The following table summarizes Chang Yuzhi's monograph *Shang Dai Zhouji Zhidu* (商代周祭制度, 1987). The book systematically discusses how the five types of rites of the Shang Dynasty are inferred from oracle bone inscriptions (甲骨文, jiaguwen).
Many scholars have summarized this content, primarily through textual tables. However, I believe that the table I have created offers greater clarity and conciseness, and I hope it will be a valuable reference for other students.
