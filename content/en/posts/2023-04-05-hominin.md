As I find osteology extremely interesting, I decide to write a special series for osteology based on my notes of [Anth 207x: Introduction to Human Evolution](https://learning.edx.org/course/course-v1:WellesleyX+ANTH207x_2+2T2015/home) lectured by Professor Adam Van Arsdale of Wellesley College. {{<end>}}


The fossile of **Orrorin tugenensis** was also discovered in 2001. They lived sometime 6 million years ago in Tugen Hills region, Rift Valley, Kenya.

 The most significant fossil of Orrorin tugenensis is a proximal femoral fragment becuase some features of this femur indicate that they might be bipedal.

**1. Obturator externus groove**
  
Obturator externus groove is commonly see in human femora. This groove is associated with the contact between the muscular tendon and the neck of the femur during bipedal locomotion. 
  
**2. Asymmetrical distribution of bone**
  
I have introduced this trait in my previous blog. The cross sections of this femur show kind of asymmetrical distribution of bone (right yellow circles) compared to those of apes (left yellow circles) which means that it may be bipedal.

I also find the website of [The Smithsonian Institution's Human Origins Program](https://humanorigins.si.edu/evidence/human-fossils/species/orrorin-tugenensis) quite informative.
