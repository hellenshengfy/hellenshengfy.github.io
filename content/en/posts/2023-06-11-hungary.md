I just read *Pass the skeleton key… Animals in an early Copper Age inhumation burial from Pusztataskony–Ledence I, Hungary* and find two statistical issues.

On page 85, a statistical table is presented:
{{<figure src="https://hellenshengfy.github.io/issue_1.png">}}

And the interpretation of the table goes like this:

  {{<block class="warning" >}}
Condescending attitudes toward hares slightly outnumber those showing sympathy causing a moderate positive skew in the distribution, a visual trend also expressed in the
univariate statistics calculated for the 39 proverbs (Figure7.13).

The mean score is only slightly below the median explaining the slight positive skew in the diagram. Importantly, the negative kurtosis expresses the great number of neutral proverbs concentrated around the median. It is impossible to tell whether placing the hare in the early Copper Age grave was the expression of a positive or negative attitude toward the deceased herself, or whether it was related 'simply' to gender. The latter possibility seems to be indirectly supported by the occurrence of hare remains in female burials in various archaeological periods. However, given the dualistic perceptions of animals and their sophisticated associations with fractal identities, the Copper Age meaning of this zoological find assemblage remains largely unresolved.

**Unfortunately, the analysis on the skewness and kuitosis is wrong.** 

(1) if the mean score is less than the median, it is a **negative** skew instead of a positive one.
  
(2) A **positive** kurtosis expresses the great number of neutral proverbs concentrated around the median, instead of a negative one.

I think authors either messed up the values of these two statistics or got confused by their statistical meanings.
