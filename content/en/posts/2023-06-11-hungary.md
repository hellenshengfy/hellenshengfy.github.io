I just read an archaeological paper and find two statistical issues.

The statistical table in the paper:

And the interpretation of the table goes like this: 

{{<block class="note">}}

.....positive skew in the distribution.....negative kurtosis....

{{< end >}}

Unfortunately, the analysis on the skewness and kuitosis might be problematic.

(1) If the mean score is less than the median, it is a **negative** skew instead of a positive one.
  
(2) A **positive** kurtosis expresses the great number of neutral proverbs concentrated around the median, instead of a negative one.
