I just read an archaeological paper and find two statistical issues.

One statistical table is presented:
{{<figure src="https://hellenshengfy.github.io/issue_1.png">}}

And the interpretation of the table goes like this: .....positive skew in the distribution.....negative kurtosis....
{{< end >}}

Unfortunately, the analysis on the skewness and kuitosis might be problematic.

(1) If the mean score is less than the median, it is a **negative** skew instead of a positive one.
  
(2) A **positive** kurtosis expresses the great number of neutral proverbs concentrated around the median, instead of a negative one.
