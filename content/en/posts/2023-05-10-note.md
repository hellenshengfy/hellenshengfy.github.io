## Chapter 0: Hominids, Hominioid, Hominines, Hominins: Whatâ€™s the difference?

Hominids, Hominioid, Hominines and Hominins? When I first come up with these terms, I was quite confused and found it hard to distinguish one from the other. After reading the paper *Human Evolution: Taxonomy and Paleobiology*, I decide to write this article and introduce you these terms under new taxonomic classification system based on molecular evidence.

First of all, let me show you the chart, to make things easier. This chart is drawn based on the taxonomy table illustrated in *Human Evolution: Taxonomy and Paleobiology*.

I also find the family tree on the website of [The Smithsonian Institution's Human Origins Program](https://humanorigins.si.edu/evidence/human-family-tree) quite informative. {{<end>}}
  
Now we could tell the correct sequence of these terms, from the broadest to the narrowest: **Hominoidea [Hominoids] - Hominidae [Hominids] -Homininae [Hominines] - Hominini [Hominins]**. 

- **Hominoidea [Hominoids]** is the broadest term and is a superfamily including humans, the gibbons, and the great apes (orangutan, chimpanzee, and gorilla).

- **Hominidae [Hominids]** excludes the gibbons, and is a family including orangutans, gorillas, chimps and humans.

- **Homininae [Hominines]** further excludes orangutans and gorillas, and is a subfamily including chimps and humans. Homininae shows the close relationship of humans and chimps.

- **Hominini [Hominins]** is the subfamily we humans belongs to.


{{<block class="important" >}}
Note: Many people say that chimps are our ancestors. However, this is a misunderstanding. As what we can see from the chart above, Pan is the sister clay to Homos. The development history of chimps since the seperation of our common ancestor is as long as that of human beings.

## Chapter 1: Canine and honing complex

In order to eat raw meat, apes developed strong canians together with a honing complex. Honing complex is a complex that (1) the lower canines project into the diastema between the upper canine and the lateral incisor and (2) the upper canine projects into the diastema between the lower canine and the lower third premolar. 
  
 {{<figure src="https://hellenshengfy.github.io/honing complex.jpg" title="Honing complex illustration from my notes">}}

Honing complex creates a structure where the upper and lower dentition rub against each other, leading to particularly the sharp honing edge on the posterior edge of the canine. 

Within this complex, the upper canine looks like a projecting dagger and could continually sharpen itself against the lower dentition. The third premolar, the tooth behind the canine, takes on a specialized morphology in its anterior portion which is associated with its articulation with the upper canine.

With the reduction of canine, this complex is also reduced in *Homo*. 


## Chapter 2: How eating habit impacts skull

I mentioned strong canine in primates in the last chapter, so what a strong canine can lead to? Actually, it will exert great influence on the structure of canium. 

 - **Prominent snout**. Roots of canines extend up into the rostrum resulting in more prominent snout on the skull. In contrast, humans have a very flat face.

- **U shaped dentation**. This morphology is created to situate the honign complex. 
  
   {{<figure src="https://hellenshengfy.github.io/dentation.jpg">}}

Besides, chewing motion also impacts the skull. For primates like chimps and gorillas, they have much larger muscles than us, especially temporalis. 
  
   {{<figure src="https://hellenshengfy.github.io/temporalis.jpg" title="Photo credit to https://thewellnessdigest.com/temporalis-muscle-headaches-head-cheek-teeth-pain">}}
  
   {{<figure src="https://hellenshengfy.github.io/osteo.jpg">}}

- **Temporal fascia**. The area of the temporal fascia and the superior extent of temporalis along the skull is much reduced for human.
  
- **Pronounced toruses near the occipital area**. In ape's specimen, there are pronounced toruses along the back of the skull. And these toruses are the bracketing points for muscular attachments of the jaw. 

- **Sagittal crest**. In the case of gorillas, their muscles are so large that the right and left muscles intersect at the center of the skull, forming sagittal crest.This is the attachment point separating that right temporalis muscle from the left temporalis muscle.


## Chapter 3: How does bipedality influence our skeleton
  
 Being bipedality is a tremendous shift. It involves changes of entire skeleton: 
  
### Femur

#### 1. Bicondylar angle 

Being bipedal means we walk on one leg for every step and this means great weight and pressure on our legs. In order to solve this issue, our skeleton creates a ***bicondylar angle***, which helps to bring our weight closer to our midline. 

{{<figure src="https://hellenshengfy.github.io/bicondylar_angle.jpg">}}

The bicondylar angle is the angle between the midline of the femoral shaft (purple) and the perpendicular line (blue) to the plane created by the femoral condyles (black). If we contrast our femur with a chimp's femur, we will notice that the chimp's femur would be more straight as they're quadrupeds, i.e. they do not load the weight on a single leg and thus do not need that angle to for bone protection.


#### 2. Long femur neck and muscular attachment sites

Bicondylar angle, on the one hand, means that the distal femur is medially displaced; on the other, it also means the proximal is laterally positoned. To achieve this, we need a long femur neck. Besides, strong muscles are required to stabilize the pelvis and the hips in bipedal locomotion. There are many big muscular attachment sites at the proximal end of the femur.

{{<figure src="https://hellenshengfy.github.io/femur_leg.jpg">}}

#### 3. Asymmetrical pattern of bone distribution

In a CT scan, we expect an asymmetrical pattern of human bone distribution and more symmetrically distributed bone in chimps. This is also becasue of the fact that we load forces on our legs from limited angles over and over agian while chimps loads femur in various angles. 
  
{{<figure src="https://hellenshengfy.github.io/CT_scan.jpg">}}
  
  
### Less curved tibia

Compared with the chimp's tibia, human tibia is less curved and less flexed. This is because we human beings exclusively load our tibia from an anterior/posterior direction but chimps ***knuckwalk quadrupedally***. Chimps do a lot of different activities where tibia get involved, such as climing the tree. As a result, they developed a more flexed shaft.

{{<figure src="https://hellenshengfy.github.io/zibo.jpg" title=" Photo taken from Shanghai Natural History Museum">}}
  
### Bowl-like pelvis

Human beings developed bowl-like pelvis to support our upper body in bipedal locomotion and stablize the lower body. This shape also frees up our lumbar vertebrae, providing more room and flexbility for it. In contrast, other ape's vertebrae are bracketed by the superior portion of the os coxae. 

### Others

- Humans are of lower ratio of arm length to leg length. 
- Humans have relatively shorter fingers and longer thumbs. 
- Humans have an adducted hallux. 
- Huamn toes are locked in position with little movement capabilities. They are designed to help maintain balance.  
  
## Chapter 4: The earliest possible hominins
  
As we already know that chimps are not our ancestors, then who is? Any evidence of the earliest possible hominins? 

Currently, there are three candidates we know:

### Earliest possible hominins

| **Name** | **Place** | **Date** |
|---------|---------|---------|
| Sahelanthropus tchadensis | Lake Chad Basin, Central Africa | 6-7 mya |
| Orrorin tugenensis | Central Rift Valley, East Africa | 6 mya |
| Ardipithecus kadabba & ramidus | Ethiopia & Kenya, East Africa | 4-6 mya |
  
{{<figure src="https://hellenshengfy.github.io/homini1.jpg">}}

These candidates show somewhat reduced canine size and obligate or habitual bipedality. I will write blogs to introduce the osteological evidence of them in the following days.

  {{<block class="note">}}
I also find the family tree on the website of [The Smithsonian Institution's Human Origins Program](https://humanorigins.si.edu/evidence/human-family-tree) quite informative. {{<end>}}

### Sahelanthropus
  
Discovered in 2001, Sahelanthropus was found in the desert of the Lake Chad basin in Central Africa.

{{<figure src="https://hellenshengfy.github.io/homini2.jpg">}}
  
Why we say that Sahelanthropus mgiht be a member of hominins?  There are several osteological evidence to support this hypothesis :

- **Relatively small canine**. Although it does not seem like small, some argue that this is a male skull and it is relatively small for a male. 
- **Apical wear of tooth**. Form the picture, we can see the tip of the crown is wearing instead of posterior edge, which is quite human-like chewing motion. 
- **Forward positioned foramen magnum**. The relative forward position of the foramen magnum relative to the orbits shows that Sahelanthropus might be bipedal.
  
{{<figure src="https://hellenshengfy.github.io/homini3.jpg">}}
  
  
### Orrorin tugenensis
  
The fossile of **Orrorin tugenensis** was also discovered in 2001. They lived sometime 6 million years ago in Tugen Hills region, Rift Valley, Kenya.
  
{{<figure src="https://hellenshengfy.github.io/homini4.jpg">}}
  
#### The femur
  
The most significant fossil of Orrorin tugenensis is a proximal femoral fragment becuase some features of this femur indicate that they might be bipedal. 
  
{{<figure src="https://hellenshengfy.github.io/homini5.jpg">}}
  
**1. Obturator externus groove**
  
Obturator externus groove is commonly see in human femora. This groove is associated with the contact between the muscular tendon and the neck of the femur during bipedal locomotion. 
  
**2. Asymmetrical distribution of bone**
  
I have introduced this trait in the previous chapter. The cross sections of this femur show kind of asymmetrical distribution of bone (right yellow circles) compared to those of apes (left yellow circles) which means that it may be bipedal. 

  {{<block class="note">}}
I also find the website of [The Smithsonian Institution's Human Origins Program](https://humanorigins.si.edu/evidence/human-fossils/species/orrorin-tugenensis) quite informative. {{<end>}}
  
### Ardipithecus
  
 Ardipithecus is divided into two separate species based on dental and mandibular evidence:
  
- Ardipithecus kadabba, dates back to about six million years ago 
  
- Ardipithecus ramidus, dates back to 4.5 to 4.8 million years ago.

Ardipithecus ramidus might be a lineal descendant of Ardipithecus kadabba according to the dental morphology. 
  
Ardipithecus is a habitual bipedality and spends significant time on the tree. 
  
{{<figure src="https://hellenshengfy.github.io/homini7.jpg">}}
  
It has three important traits that make it so special :
 
- **The development of bipedality**
  
- **Reduced honing canine**
  
- **The loss of visible estrus**

Anthropologists have come up with a model that put these traits together. A simple version of their hypothesis of Ardipithecus goes like this: 
  
1. **Ecological change** contributes to the **development of bipedality**
  
2. Bipedality frees up hands, making **extracted foraging** possible
  
3. Extracted foraging provides **additional food**
  
4. With additional food, males can **exchange food for sex** and **reproductive competition is reduced**
  
5. Reduced reproductive competition leads to **reduced honing canine** and **hidden ovulation**.
