I am amazed by the idea of "*The origins of metallurgy: distinguishing stone from metal cut-marks on bones from archaeological sites*", which turns out to be an excellent demonstration of the usage of circumstantial evidence in the investigation of the origins of metalluurgy  

In the discussion of origins of metalluurgy, our instinct is to find direct metal evidence. Unfortunately, the evidence is too rare to give us a satisfying explanation. Greenfield points out that there are several reasons for the rarity of direct evidence:

(1) Actual prehistoric rarity of metal tools. 
  
(2) Metal was too precious to be discarded, and was reused and recycled in most cases.  Most metal objects discovered are worn, broken, or finished tools and weapons that were lost, ritually deposited, or hidden and forgotten.
  
(3) Chemically unstablity of early metals. They were decomposed.
  
  
If direct evidence is not the solution, the what is? Greenfield chose to analyze cut-marks on the bone remains of animals. What a clever idea!!

Cut marks can tell us information of tools.
