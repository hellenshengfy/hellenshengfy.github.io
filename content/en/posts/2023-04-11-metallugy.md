I am amazed by the idea of "*The origins of metallurgy: distinguishing stone from metal cut-marks on bones from archaeological sites*", which turns out to be an excellent demonstration of the usage of circumstantial evidence in the investigation of the origins of metalluurgy  

In the discussion of origins of metallurgy, it is intuitive to find direct metal evidence. Unfortunately, direct evidence is too rare to be found. Reasons for the rarity of direct evidence is also mentioned in the article:

(1) Prehistoric rarity of metal tools. 
  
(2) Metal was too precious to be discarded, and was reused and recycled in most cases.  Most metal objects discovered are worn, broken, or finished tools and weapons that were lost, ritually deposited, or hidden and forgotten.
  
(3) Chemically unstablity of early metals. They were decomposed.
  
  
If direct evidence is not the solution, then what is? Greenfield chose to analyze cut-marks on the bone remains of animals. What a clever idea!!

Cut marks can tell us information of tools.
