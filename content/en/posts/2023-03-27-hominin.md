As I find osteology extremely interesting, I decide to write a special series for osteology based on my notes of [Anth 207x: Introduction to Human Evolution](https://learning.edx.org/course/course-v1:WellesleyX+ANTH207x_2+2T2015/home) lectured by Professor Adam Van Arsdale of Wellesley College. {{<end>}}


As we already know that chimps are not our ancestors, then who is? Any evidence of the earliest possible hominins? 

Currently, there are three candidates we know:

## Table

| **Name** | **Place** | **Date** |
|---------|---------|---------|
| Sahelanthropus tchadensis | Lake Chad Basin, Central Africa | ~ 6-7 mya |
| Orrorin tugenensis | Central Rift Valley, East Africa | ~ 6 mya |
| Ardipithecus kadabba and Ardipithecus ramidus | Ethiopia and Kenya, East Africa |  ~ 4-6 mya |

{{<figure src="https://hellenshengfy.github.io/homini1.jpg">}}

These candidates show somewhat reduced canine size and obligate or habitual bipedality.
