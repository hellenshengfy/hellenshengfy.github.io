I really like the edX course [Anth 207x: Introduction to Human Evolution](https://learning.edx.org/course/course-v1:WellesleyX+ANTH207x_2+2T2015/home) lectured by Professor Adam Van Arsdale of Wellesley College, and I took a series of notes to this course. This article is based on my notes.{{<end>}}
  

As we talked before that chimps and human being evolve from common ancestor, but who can we know when latest common ancestor (LCA) lived?

The answer lies in the *molecular clock*. In 1960s, geneticists found that differences in some protein structures were accumulating at a near constant rate through time, which made the time estimation of LCA possible. Given a constant accumulation of mutations, if we know how different two species are, that genetic difference can tell us how far back in past can we expect a LCA. 

Quite simple, right? Yet it is not the whole picture. The molecular clock requires calibration as it varies across different lineages. So we still not quite clear about how to calibrate the molecular clock in humans.

The current understanding of relationship between Pan and Homo leads us to expect a LCA **five to seven** million years in the past. Thatâ€™s reason why anthropologists pay special attention to sediment that are dated to five to seven million years ago.
