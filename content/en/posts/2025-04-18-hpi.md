Abstract:

To address the inconsistencies in the economic lists and improve the accuracy of the original text, this study employs a structured analytical approach grounded in modern accounting standards. The revised table is provided in the appendix (Appendix I), along with translations of selected original passages referenced throughout this essay (Appendix II).  

To better assess the relative tax burden across cities, this analysis introduces two key measures: “tax per capita” and the “tax per capita index”. These metrics enable a comparative evaluation of tax burdens and resource specialization, shedding light on the economic and geographic factors shaping regional tax profiles.
