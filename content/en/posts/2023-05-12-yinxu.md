Today, in the zooarchaeology class, we read an article about a bone factory in Tiesanlu during Anyang period (ca. 1250-1050 BCE), which is quite interesting. So I further
read related articles about other bone factories discovered in the area and here is my thoughts.

First, let us have a look at the location of three sites: Tiesanlu (2), Guandimiao(1) and Daxingzhuang(3)

Products in these sites:

{{<figure src="https://hellenshengfy.github.io/yinxu3.png" title="Photo from Wang (2022)">}}
  
 {{< endcolumn >}}

And **I make a summary table on the features of these three sites**. Dummay varibles : 1 refers to "yes" 0 refers to "no". For features in the middle, I assign 0.5 to them.

## Summary Table

| Feature | Guandimiao | Daxingzhuang | Tiesanlu |
|---------|---------|---------|---------|
| Formality | 0 | 1 | 1 |
| Standardization | 0 | 1 | 1 |
| Specialization | 0 | 0 | 1 |
| Tech | 0 | 0.5 | 1 |
| Mass production | 0 | 0 | 1 |
  
Just as what Wang (2022) said, Daxingzhuang seems to be a mixture of Guandimiao model and Tiesanlu model. It could be an evidence of multi-level economy by then or a transition of economical development. Considering the fact that there is no saw used in Daxingzhuang, I think the second explanation is of higher possibility.

Also, I want to point out one weakness of the Formality concept brought about by Wang (2022): a possible ***multicollinearity*** issue here. Because Hou(2022) discussed standization, specialization and technology when technology and standardization elements have been included in the proxy variable Formality already. I mean if Formality is accepted as a proxy, then elements within it should not be discussed together with it.
