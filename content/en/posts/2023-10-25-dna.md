I am very curious about DNA sequencing technology and its latest application on aDNA. So I spent my spare time reading articles and attending online courses ([Genome Sequencing](https://www.coursera.org/learn/genome-sequencing/home/week/1) and [DNA Decoded](https://www.coursera.org/learn/dna-decoded/home/week/1)) about DNA. I hope this article could help you know more about DNA.

Ancient DNA has been increasingly important in the field of archaeology. It is a code book which tells the life story of people, animal, plant and even bacteria. Today, let’s decode DNA together.

## Chapter 0: What is DNA

Let’s have a look of its definition in the dictionary:

DNA, abbreviation of deoxyribonucleic acid, organic chemical of complex molecular structure that is found in all prokaryotic and eukaryotic cells and in many viruses.[1] 

This is my reaction when I read this: What??? What?!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

Don’t be panic! You will know that soon.

Before we start, let me introduce you some preliminary knowledge.

In biology, molecules can be divided into large molecules (macromolecules) and small molecules according to their relative size. **DNA**, **polysaccharid** and **protein** are all large molecules. They are highly complex substance, made of simpler basic units called monomer. 

**Nucleotide** is the monomer of DNA, **amino acid** is the monomer of protein and **monosaccharid** (eg: Fructose, glucose, galactose and ribose) is the monomer of polysaccharid.

Now let’s go back to DNA again:

   {{<figure src="https://hellenshengfy.github.io/DNA1.png">}}
   
Do you see anything that is familiar to you?

Righto! **Nuleric Acid**!

The name of DNA tell you it is nucleic acid, a large molecule.

Then what is the "**Deoxyribo**"?

Do you find ribo- is similiar to the sugar “ribose”? That is exactly what it means!

The name of DNA and RNA are both derived from the sugar in its structure. For RNA (ribonucleic acid) it is Ribose and for DNA it is Deoxyribose, a ribose missing an OH group (without oxygen).

Therefore, the full name of DNA tells us that it is a nucleic acid which contains a Deoxyribose.

So, in my dictionary: 

   {{<figure src="https://hellenshengfy.github.io/DNA2.png">}}

See, it is not that horrible if you can "read" its name.

## Chapter 1: The structure of DNA

DNA has a winding, two-stranded chemical structure called "double helix" which looks much like a twisted ladder. 

{{<figure src="https://hellenshengfy.github.io/DNA3.png" title="Online photo from genome.gov">}}

Two "strands" of the ladder are antiparallel to each other (5' to 3' and 3' to 5'). 

{{<figure src="https://hellenshengfy.github.io/DNA55.png" title="Online photo from https://www.coursera.org/learn/dna-decoded/home/week/2">}}

Here 5’ and 3’ refer to the position of carbon in the structure of the ribose. 5’ is the fifth C while 3’ is the third C. 

{{<figure src="https://hellenshengfy.github.io/DNA56.png" title="Online photo from https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1uR4y1277q/?p=3&share_source=copy_web&vd_source=0e6130e11a58450d4a0ec451a367f1c5">}}


Each "rung" of the ladder is made up of two nitrogenous bases paired by hydrogen bonds. In DNA, adenine (A) always pairs with thymine (T) and cytosine (C) always pairs with guanine (G). 


{{<block class="important" >}}
  
In RNA, A always pairs with uracil (U) instead of T.

{{< end >}}


As aformentioned, DNA is made of monomer called nucleotide. Zooming in, nucleotide are made of three parts: a **phosphate**, a **sugar** and one of four types of **nitrogenous** bases. 

{{<figure src="https://hellenshengfy.github.io/DNA4.png" title="Online photo from https://www.coursera.org/learn/dna-decoded/home/week/2">}}


This is what a nitrogenous base looks like:

Thymine, cytosine, and uracil are pyrimidine bases while adenine and guanine are purine bases.

{{<figure src="https://hellenshengfy.github.io/DNA5.png" title="Edited photo based on photos from https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/biochemistry-genetics-and-molecular-biology/nitrogenous-base">}}

This is what a phosphate looks like:

{{<figure src="https://hellenshengfy.github.io/DNA66.png" title="Online photo from https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1uR4y1277q/?p=3&share_source=copy_web&vd_source=0e6130e11a58450d4a0ec451a367f1c5">}}

This is what a sugar looks like:

{{<figure src="https://hellenshengfy.github.io/DNA67.png" title="Online photo from https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1uR4y1277q/?p=3&share_source=copy_web&vd_source=0e6130e11a58450d4a0ec451a367f1c5">}}


This is how a nucleotide is made:

## Chapter 2: The replication of DNA

{{<figure src="https://hellenshengfy.github.io/DNA7.png" title="Photo from my notes">}}

- Step 1:  Two strands are unzipped by helicase, and a replication fork is formed.

- Step 2:  Primase starts the replication process by producing a RNA primer which represents the starting point of the new strand of DNA.

- Step 3: DNA polymerase binds to the primer and make the new strand of DNA by adding DNA bases in the direction from the 5 prime to the 3 prime. 

This video explains the reason in details. 

{{< youtube id="y4hKibS2fAo" autoplay="true" >}}

[Link: https://youtu.be/y4hKibS2fAo](https://youtu.be/y4hKibS2fAo)

In the leading strand, DNA is made continuously because DNA polymerase can add bases in the same direction of its movement (from the 5 prime to the 3 prime). However, in the lagging strand, DNA polymerase can only add bases in chunks (Okazaki fragments) because it moves in the opposite direction. Each fragment is started with an RNA primer.

- Step 4: Exonuclease removes all the RNA primers.

- Step 5: Another DNA polymerase fills in the gaps.

- Step 6: DNA ligase seals up the folk. 

This video visualize the whole process:

## Chapter 3: The transcription and translation of DNA

If we compare DNA to the commander of our body, then proteins must be soldiers who undertake various responsibilities. But how could DNA send command signals and produce proteins? To achieve this, **central dogma** tells us that, DNA should be first copied (transcription) into RNA and then translated to specific amino acid sequence of a protein (translation) through transfer RNA in ribosome. 

{{<figure src="https://hellenshengfy.github.io/DNA9.png" >}}

tRMA serves as a temporary carrier of amino acids during protein synthesis.

## Chapter 4: DNA sequencing


To decode DNA, we need to cut it into pieces and amplify these DNA fragment using PCR (Polymerase Chain Reaction)  where dideoxynucleotides with fluorescent labels that halt DNA strand elongation are introduced. These dideoxynucleotides work as terminators so that DNA fragments of different sizes can be generated. At last, sequences are determined by computer according to the color of terminator bases.

## Chapter 5: DNA sequencing application 


The DNA sequencing can be used in various ways. For example, DNA barcoding can help us to determine unknown species by checking again database. In DNA barcoding, the CO1 region of mitochondria is selected. CO1 region is of great advantage because:

(1) universal primers are available which makes identification of species possible

(2) the region is of rapid revolution rate which makes identification of species meaningful 

(3) mitochondria are numerous which makes identification of species much easier.

Another technique for taxa identification is ZooMs. For details of ZooMs, please read my previous blog "[A Brief Introduction on ZooMS](https://hellenshengfy.github.io/en/2023/06/21/cfa/)" .
