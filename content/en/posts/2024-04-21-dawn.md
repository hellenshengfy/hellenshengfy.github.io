I spent a month reading the book *The Dawn of Everything*, a profound exploration of archaeological and anthropological discoveries alongside an insightful literature review. It proved to be an invaluable source of learning, prompting me to compile detailed notes for further reference. I hope these notes can also be helpful to you.{{<end>}}


## Chapter 3: Challenging Conventional Wisdom

### Schismogenesis

Schismogenesis, first coined by anthropologist Gregory Bateson in the 1930s, describes people’s tendency to define themselves against one another. For me, the term seems to be peculiar and counterintuitive at first glance because it naturally occurs to me that cultures tend to mimic each other and be influenced by others rather than exacerbate differences, leading to further separation.

The book provides 4 compelling examples of this process.

#### 1. North America: Northwest Coast Peoples vs Californian Foragers


{{<figure src="https://hellenshengfy.github.io/dawn_10.jpg" title="Photo from my notes">}}

Anthropologists have categorized the indigenous inhabitants of North
America’s western region into two broad culture domains: ‘California’ and the‘Northwest Coast’. And the most notable distinction between these two areas lies in the presence of formal ranks and the institution of potlatch.

Northwest Coast Peoples:

- Depend on fishing, marine mammals, terrestrial plants for sustenance
- Richly decorated houses and totem poles
- Societies are dominated by warrior aristocracies, with a notable portion of the populace comprising slaves
- Practice feasts and potlash
- An example of the group：Kwakiutl

  - Exuberant ornamentation of art, dazzling material cultures and performance
  - Hereditary ranks: nobles--commoners--slaves

California Foragers:
- Make use of terrestrial resources: nuts and acorns as staple
- Exhibit plain house exteriors but produce highly patterned baskets for storage and serving food
- Generally do not practice slavery.
- An example of the group：Yurok

{{<figure src="https://hellenshengfy.github.io/dawn_13.jpg" title="Photo of Yoruk people">}}

Note: online photo from [https://www.onlytribal.com/yurok-tribe.asp](https://www.onlytribal.com/yurok-tribe.asp)

- Hold the belief in human equality and emphasize hard work and self-discipline

- Yurok men stay away from indulgence like eating, sexual gratification while Yurok women keep their body slim

- Money plays a central role in their life but it is only an outward manifestation of their hard work.

- No inherited ranks or titles

Actually, Yoruk is not a typical representative of California people as they did hold slaves (but only a few) and it is among few areas where dentalium could be inherited (for other places in California, money and other wealth was ritually burned at people’s death).

The case is meaningful because it is in the buffer area between two regions and became a mixture of the two.

##### Summary Table

| Northwest Coast People| Californian Foragers |
|---------|---------|
| Fisher Kings | Protestant Foragers |

#### 2. Fertile Crescent: Upland Crescent vs Lowland Crescent

{{<figure src="https://hellenshengfy.github.io/dawn_14.png" title="Map of the Fertile Crescent">}}

Note: Photo illustrated in *The Dawning of Everything*

The upland crescent occupied the foothills of the Taurus and Zagros Mountains, while the lowland crescent resided in the south characterized by Pistacia woodlands. These two groups of people maintained close relations and traded durable materials through the "Levantine Corridor."
The Fertile Crescent became a cultural frontier for the two groups. One trended towards hierarchy and male violence, as evidenced by megalithic centers like Göbekli Tepe, while the other gravitated towards recognizing women as co-creators of society, where megalithic works were absent.
A stark contrast exists in their treatment of skulls. While the uplanders celebrated male violence and accumulated heads as trophies, the lowlanders opted to decorate skulls, thus negating the logic of violence.

##### Summary Table

| Upland Crescent| Lowland Crescent |
|---------|---------|
| Hierarchy and megalithic monuments | Absence of megalithic monuments | 
| Symbolism of male virility and predation that largely excluded female concerns	| Organize societies around female knowledge and symbolism| 


#### 3. Mesoamerica: Zapotec vs Teotihuacan

Before the advent of the Mexica (Aztecs), Teotihuacan used to govern itself without overlords. Royal temples, ball-courts, and kingly images—standard features of its Mesoamerican neighbors—were absent in the area.

##### Summary Table

| Zapotec| Teotihuacan |
|---------|---------|
| Feature ball courts	| Lack ceremonial ball-court| 
| Tradition of relief carving derived from the earlier Olmec kings of Veracruz	| Sculpture of humans and humanoid figures | 
| Favouring curves and flowing forms	| Flat composites tightly fitted to angular blocks| 



#### 4. Aztec Empire: Tenochtitlan vs Tlaxcala

In close proximity to the Aztec capital of Tenochtitlan, Tlaxcala played a pivotal role in the Spanish conquest of the Aztec Empire. Unlike its powerful neighbor, the place did not have a king.

{{<figure src="https://hellenshengfy.github.io/dawn_18.png" title="Photo from My Notes">}}

Thanks to the accounts of the Franciscan friar Toribio of Benavente and "Historia de los Indios de la Nueva España", we are able to know some aspects of Tlaxcala's societal structure. Tlaxcala operated as an indigenous republic governed by a council of elected officials (teuctli). Individuals aspiring to a role on the council were required to subordinate themselves to the people of the city. Each underwent trials, beginning with mandatory exposure to public abuse, followed by a long period of seclusion. The initiation process concluded with the public emergence of the newly appointed servant, marked by feasting and celebration.

### Freedom and Dominance

For coherence, I will include this content in the subsequent article. In essence, three primary forms of freedom are the freedom to move, to disobey orders, and to reorganize social relations. Conversely, three primary forms of dominance entail the control of violence, the control of information, and individual charisma.
