Iif you are given these coordinates in GIS, how do you know where is it?

X=500001

Y=1

To read these coordinates, prerequisite knowledge such as referenced ellipsoid, plane coordinates, and map projections is a necessity.

# The referenced ellipsoid

To start with, let us have a look at the Earth. In reality, the earth is not a round ball but a misshapen object.

Commonly, referenced ellipsoid (sphere) defined by semi-major axis (a), semi-minor axis (b), and flattening (f) is used to approximate the size and shape of the earth.

 In China, we use CGCS2000 system and its referenced ellipsoid is very similar to that of WGS.

| System | Semi-major a (m) | Semi-major b (m)|Inverse flattening1/f|
|---------|---------|---------|---------|
|World Geodetic System 1984 - WGS 84 |6,378,137|	6 356 752.3142 |298.257 223 563|
|Global Reference System 1980 - GRS 80 |6 378 137|	6 356 752.3141|298.257 222 101|

Note: Different referenced ellipsoids are used in different regions to make the ellipsoid fit the real surface of that region the best.

Now we have a reference ellipsoid, then what’s next?

# Plane coordinates and map projections

Let’s go back to the coordinates in the very beginning. 

X=500001

Y=1

Unlike the latitude and longitude coordinates that we use in daily life, these are plane coordinates. It is the projection of points on earth’s roughly spherical surface on the plane.

Various projection methods are used in practice. Common projections include Mercator projection, Gauss-Krüger projection and UTM projection .

**1. Mercator**

Mercator projection applies a secant cylinder that touches the ellipsoid along the equator. 

Imagine there is a light in the center of the earth. Every points on the earth will be projected onto the cylinder and we get a flatten map. Coordinates of every point on that map will be determined once the origin is set.

**2. Gauss-Krüger projection (transverse Mercator projection)**

Gauss-Krüger projection is a transverse version of Mercator in which the cylinder intersects the meridian. The Gauss-Krüger coordinate system is used in Europe, Russia, and China. The system has both 3- and 6-degree-wide zones.

**3.Universal Transverse Mercator (UTM)**

UTM varies from Gauss-Krüger projections by using a secant cylinder that intersects the ellipsoid along two small circles parallel to the Central Meridian.

There are 60 UTM zones on the Earth and each of them is a 6‎° segment. 

# False easting and northing

Note that the central meridian of each zone is assigned an arbitrary number of 500,000 to avoid any negative easting while the equator is assigned a number of 10,000,000 for points in the southern to avoid any negative northing. This is called false easting and northing.

So basically, X=500001 and Y=1 is the dot (1,1). 1 meter from the origin on the x-axis and 1 meter from the origin on the y-axis.
