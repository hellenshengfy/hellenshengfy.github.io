As I find osteology extremely interesting, so I made a special osteology series from my notes based on [Anth 207x: Introduction to Human Evolution](https://learning.edx.org/course/course-v1:WellesleyX+ANTH207x_2+2T2015/home) lectured by Professor Adam Van Arsdale of Wellesley College. {{<end>}}


In order to eat raw meat, apes developed strong canians together with a honing complex. Honing complex is a complex that (1) the lower canines project into the diastema between the upper canine and the lateral incisor and (2) the upper canine projects into the diastema between the lower canine and the lower third premolar.

Honing complex creates a structure where the upper and lower dentition rub against each other, leading to particularly the sharp honing edge on the posterior edge of the canine. 

Within this complex, the upper canine looks like a projecting dagger and could continually sharpen itself against the lower dentition. The third premolar, the tooth behind the canine, takes on a specialized morphology in its anterior portion which is associated with its articulation with the upper canine.

With the reduction of canine, this complex is also reduced in *Homo*.
