As I find osteology extremely interesting, so I made a special osteology series from my notes based on [Anth 207x: Introduction to Human Evolution](https://learning.edx.org/course/course-v1:WellesleyX+ANTH207x_2+2T2015/home) lectured by Professor Adam Van Arsdale of Wellesley College. {{<end>}}

Why we are bipedal creatures? There are various hypothesis: 

- Temperature: The environment in East African is hot and relatively dry, and it's easier for a bipedal to stay cool during the day. Because most of body parts are away from the ground, bipedal species suffer from less thermal radiation.

- Evolution: Orthograde posture has been seen in primates simply out of revolution reason. Some early hominin ancestor might have been an above-branch walker.

- Predators: Many primates are quite small and exposed to predators. Bipedal can help to get higher point of vision so as to avoid predators 

- Activities: Bipedal frees up hands and help our ancestors to do various activities like carrying things.
