{{<block class="note">}}

The evolution of social organization is mentioned for many times in the classes I attended this semester. So I decided to write an article to summerize and compare different theories on the topic.

## Lewis Morgan

Lewis Morgan brought up the idea of "Savagery-Barbarism-Civilization" stages in his *Ancient Society*. 

| Periods | Divisions |Conditions|
|---------|---------|---------|
|Savagery |I. Lower Status of Savagery|	 Infancy of the Human Race |
|Savagery |II. Middle Status of Savagery|	Acquisition of a fish subsistence and a knowledge of the use of fire|
|Savagery |III. Upper Status of Savagery|	Invention of the Bow and Arrow|
|Barbarism |IV. Lower Status of Barbarism|	Invention of the Art of Pottery|
|Barbarism| V. Middle Status of Barbarism|	Domestication of animals on the Eastern hemisphere, and in the Western from the cultivation of maize and plants by Irrigation, with the use of adobe-brick and stone|
|Barbarism |VI. Upper Status of Barbarism|	Invention of the process of Smelting Iron Ore, with the use of iron tools|
|Civilization| VII. Status of Civilization|	Invention of a Phonetic Alphabet, with the use of writing|

During savergery and barbarism stage, Lewis Morgan further defined 4 organizations of society.

(1) **Gens**: a body of consanguinei having a common gentile name
(2) **Phratry**: an assemblage of related gentes united in a higher association for certain common objects
(3) **Tribe**: an assemblage of gentes, usually organized in phratries, all the members of which spoke the same dialect
(4) **Confederacy of tribes**: members spoke dialects of the same stock language. It resulted in a gentile society (*societas*), as distinguished from a political society or state (*civitas*). 

## Elman Service and Kwang-chih Chang 

Lewis Morgan believed that social members were equal before the civilization stage, which was later disproved by other ethnographic evidence. 

Elman Service came up with chiefdom theory based on new evidence in his *Primitive Social Organization* and Kwang-chih Chang applied this theory into the discussion of Chinese society in his discussion of Chinese bronze age.
