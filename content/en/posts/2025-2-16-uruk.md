In 1972, excavations at Mawangdui uncovered three Han Dynasty tombs, with Tomb No. 1 being the best preserved. Sealed with charcoal and white clay, the tomb contained a set of four intricately decorated coffins and numerous furnishings. The coffins housed the mummified remains of Lady Dai, whose husband ruled Changsha area from 193 to 186 BC. A T-shaped polychrome silk painting, measuring 205 cm, was found atop the innermost coffin, marking the first discovery of its kind in China. Due to a lack of historical records, the purpose and imagery of the silk painting remain uncertain. This research aims to consolidate scholarly views for a better understanding of the artifact.
