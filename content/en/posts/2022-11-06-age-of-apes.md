Miocene (a period between 22 million years ago and 5 million years ago) is sometimes known as "The Age of Apes". A great diversity of apes lived on various continents of our planet during Miocene and the environment and the climate of the world was quite different from today. 

During Miocene, the Mediterranean Sea used to be an open corridor of ocean during instead of a closed body of water. It thus connected the Atlantic Ocean and the Indian Ocean, allowing tropical forests to grow throughout Eurasia, not limited to tropical regions.

However, tectonic forces changed everything. When Africa moved closer to the Middle East, the Mediterranean became a closed ocean. Miocene came to an end and the global climate changed. The tropical forest across Eurasia gave way to temperate forests, causing the extinction of many ape species. 

**It is a sad story, but it is also the point where human evolution begins.**
