Majiangbang Culture, named after Majiangbang river and villages nearby in Jiaxing, was found in 1959, during Great Leap Forward period when fertilizer was badly needed in order to produce food and goods. Because many animal bones, once treated as good fertilizer, were found on the site, villagers rushed to the place and this caught the attention of the local archaeology authority. The first and second excavation was conducted in 1959 and 2009.

So far, hundreds of tombs together with jue-earrings, huang-pendants and other jade ornaments are unearthed. Fu-cauldrons with flared collar, dou-stemmed plates with red cover outside and black inside, Gui of weird shapes and Yue-axe with sloped upper part are most distinguished objects among all. Unlike Liangzhu culture, Majiangbang people used potteries for utility instead of for political and ritual purpose.

Nevertheless, they did not depend on agriculture since remains of fish, deer, domesticated pig and other animals were found. Based on archaeological findings, Majiangbang people was most likley supported by a combination of fishing, hunting and gathering economy.

The appearance of bones of migration fishes like sea bass puzzled archaeologists. How can they arrive Majiangbang, a place away from the sea coast.
