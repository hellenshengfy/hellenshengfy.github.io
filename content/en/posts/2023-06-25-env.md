1. Phases A and G : High frequencies of marine and brackish water diatoms and estuRINE NPMs - estuarine environments
  
2. Phases B to F : High frequencies of freshwater sedimentation - reduced sea-level
  - B : Increases in grass(Poaceae<40mm) and freshwater marsh herb pollen - progressively shallower water; Abundant Cercophora - fenâ€“marshland vegetation
  
  - C : Swamp woodland NPMs and aquatic/fen taxa collapse and micro-charcoal frequencies increase tenfold - first cultural episode
  
  - D : Woodland regeneration and reduced micro fossil evidence of cultural activity - flooding
                                         
  - E/F : Fungal spores indicative ofsoil disturbance and erosion - intensive exploitation
