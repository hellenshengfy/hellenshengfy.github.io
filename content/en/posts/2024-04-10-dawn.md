I spent a month reading the book *The Dawn of Everything*, a profound exploration of archaeological and anthropological discoveries alongside an insightful literature review. It proved to be an invaluable source of learning, prompting me to compile detailed notes for further reference. Hope the notes can help you as well.{{<end>}}

## Chapter 1: The Essence of the Book

In a nutshell, the authors of *The Dawn of Everything* did **THREE** things:

**1. They challenged the conventional notions of an evolutionary human past** and ideas like
   
- Classifying societies by means of **subsistence** (thus agriculture could be a fundamental break)
- Societies grew complex when **scale** grew larger
- The complexity means **hierarchical ranks**

by shedding light on overlooked cases and asking the real question of **how did we get stuck in a single social arrangement** when different forms of social organization used to be adopted by our ancestors and even often in non-hierarchical ways?

**2. They introduced three key words**
   
- **Schiesmogensis**
- **Freedom**
- **Dominance**
  
into the study of anthropology and archaeology.  

**3. They proposed a reclassification of societies** into
   
- **First-order regimes** (organize around 1 elementary form of the domination)
- **Second-order regimes** (organize around 2 elementary forms of the domination)
- **Third-order regimes** (organize around 3 elementary forms of the domination) 

based on three elementary forms of dominance (control of violence/control of knowledge/charismatic power).

In *The Dawn of Everything*, a diverse array of archaeological cultures and sites are referenced, spanning continents and millennia. And I drew a map for this:
