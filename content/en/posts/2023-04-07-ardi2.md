I really like the edX course [Anth 207x: Introduction to Human Evolution](https://learning.edx.org/course/course-v1:WellesleyX+ANTH207x_2+2T2015/home) lectured by Professor Adam Van Arsdale of Wellesley College, and I took a series of notes to this course. This article is based on my notes.{{<end>}}

Ardipithecus is divided into two separate species based on dental and mandibular evidence:
  
- Ardipithecus kadabba, dates back to about 6 million years ago 
  
- Ardipithecus ramidus, dates back to 4.5 to 4.8 million years ago.

Ardipithecus ramidus might be a lineal descendant of Ardipithecus kadabba according to the dental morphology. 
  
Ardipithecus is a habitual bipedality and spends significant time on the tree.

It has three important traits that make it so special :
 
- **The development of bipedality**
  
- **Reduced honing canine**
  
- **The loss of visible estrus**

Anthropologists have come up with a model that put these traits together. A simple version of their hypothesis of Ardipithecus goes like this: 
  
1. **Ecological change** contributes to the **development of bipedality**
  
2. Bipedality frees up hands, making **extracted foraging** possible
  
3. Extracted foraging provides **additional food**
  
4. With additional food, males can **exchange food for sex** and **reproductive competition is reduced**
  
5. Reduced reproductive competition leads to **reduced honing canine** and **hidden ovulation**.
