As I find osteology extremely interesting, I decide to write a special series for osteology based on my notes of [Anth 207x: Introduction to Human Evolution](https://learning.edx.org/course/course-v1:WellesleyX+ANTH207x_2+2T2015/home) lectured by Professor Adam Van Arsdale of Wellesley College. {{<end>}}


I mentioned strong canine in primates in my last blog, so what a strong canine can lead to? Actually, it will exert great influence on the structure of canium. 

 - **Prominent snout**. Roots of canines extend up into the rostrum resulting in more prominent snout on the skull. In contrast, humans have a very flat face.

- **U shaped dentation**. This morphology is created to situate the honign complex.

Besides, chewing motion also impacts the skull. For primates like chimps and gorillas, they have much larger muscles than us, especially temporalis.

- **Temporal fascia**. The area of the temporal fascia and the superior extent of that muscle along the sides of the skull is much reduced for human.
  
- **Pronounced toruses near the occipital area**. In ape's specimen, there are pronounced toruses along the back of the skull. And these toruses are the bracketing points for muscular attachments of the jaw. 

- **Sagittal crest**. In the case of gorillas, their muscles are so large that the right and left muscles intersect at the center of the skull, forming sagittal crest.This is the attachment point separating that right temporalis muscle from the left temporalis muscle.
