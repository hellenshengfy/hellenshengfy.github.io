I spent a month reading the book *The Dawn of Everything*, a profound exploration of archaeological and anthropological discoveries alongside an insightful literature review. It proved to be an invaluable source of learning, prompting me to compile detailed notes for further reference. I hope these notes can also be helpful to you.{{<end>}}


## Chapter2: Challenging Conventional Wisdom

### 1. On An Evolutionary Past

Before delving into the challenge of conventional wisdom, let’s revisit the tradition first.

**Rousseau-Hobbes-Turgot and evolutionary thinking**.

*The Dawn of Everything* begins with 2 contrasting views of human history:

A. We human beings are getting worse

- As what Jean-Jacques Rousseau proposed in *Discourse on the Origin and the Foundation of Inequality Among Mankind* (1754):

```
Innocent egalitarian bands fell into a worse condition of “civilization” following the Agricultural Revolution and the rise of cities.
```

B. We human beings are getting better

- As what Thomas Hobbes described in *Leviathan* (1651):

```
"Solitary, poor, nasty, brutish, and short" savages became civilized beings through the collective repression of human instincts
```

These two philosophical views and subsequent evolutionary frameworks of

- A. R. J. Turgot : hunting gatherer-pastoralism-agricultural society-industrial society
- Lewis Henry Morgan: savagery-barbarism-civilization
- Marxists: primitive communism-slavery- feudalism-capitalism
- Elman Service: bands-tribes-chiefdoms-states
- Neo evolutionist: a new sequence based on the efficiency of energy harnesses 

have often constrained our understanding of human history into linear stages, that is, to **mistakenly recognize life in symbiotic relation with each other into separate stages of human history**.

As the book elucidates: 
{{<block class="info">}}
You can’t speak of an evolution from band to tribe to chiefdom to state if your starting points are groups that move fluidly between them as a matter of habit.

This statement gains credence from archaeological evidence of anomalous individuals, institutional flexibility, conscious political actors and seasonal dualism in paleolithic period (eg: The II Principe burial showed the potential presence of social stratification; some societies in the ice age shifted from foraging bands to concentrated settlement around the year) and later periods (eg: the Kwakiutl indigenous hunter-gatherers of Canada’s Northwest Coast crystallize into hierarchical forms with “potlatch” in winter and revert to smaller clan in summer).

### 2. On Inevitable Inequality (states/inequality/hierarchy)
   
**A. Why agriculture does not necessarily mean the rising of states**

Direct answers given by the book are: 

 1. Agriculture does not inherently foster inequality because many first farming communities were relatively free of ranks and hierarchies. 

 2. There is little evidence supporting the notion that early bureaucrats rise with complicated irrigation systems because farmers demonstrated the ability to coordinate such systems by themselves. 

 3. It takes too long (thousands of years) for the rising of states to happen after the “invention” of agriculture. It’s hard to say there is a direct link between cities and agriculture. 

 4. Whether agriculture is “invented” before or after settlement is also a question worth thinking. A new theory about the origin of agriculture tells a totally different story: Agriculture began after the settlement. People started to harvest wild grasses because they found their stalks quite useful (in fuel, clothing, and clay temper) in post-settlement life, thereby creating a key condition for the loss of the natural mechanism of seed dispersal. Further, farming potentially began as an underdog, filling gaps left behind by foragers, as it was still a “golden age” for foragers. An example of such “underdog” is the failure of linear pottery culture. 

**B. Why scale does not necessarily mean inequality**
 
 1. Large Scale with Self-Governance:
    
- There is no evidence of central administration in Ukrainian mega-sites like Taljanky nor of a ruling class in Mohenjo-Dar of the Indus Valley, or monarchy in earliest Mesopotamian cities like Uruk.
- The circular layout of sites like Nebelivka suggests egalitarian principles akin to those observed in Basque societies.

- The revolution in Taosi indicates a self-conscious social experimentation against prior inequitable structures.


2. Small Scale with Administrative Control:
    
- First systems of specialized administrative control emerged in very small communities. Tell Sabi Abyad, a one-hectare village with a population of 150 people in Mesopotamia, had central storage facilities and administrative devices like economic archives.

- The ayllu system in Andean societies, small-scale bureaucracies, worked in practice, kept records, and handled all outstanding credits, and was responsible for taking care of people and redistributing land. 

**C. Why complexity does not necessarily lead to hierarchical ranks**

 1. Complex Metropolis without Hierarchy:

    The earliest Mesopotamian cities, such as Mashkan-shapir, present no clear evidence for monarchy at all. The excavation in this 4000-year-old Babylonian city showed even distribution of wealth and administrative tools across the five main districts, with no obvious center of commercial or political power. In Uruk, great communal assembly halls and open temples might indicate great importance of public affairs over centralized authority.

 2. Small 'Heroic' Societies with Top-Down Rulers
   
    The discovery of the “earliest known palace” in Arslantepe, a small site in the Malatya Plain of eastern Turkey, challenges the notion that first top-down rulers emerged solely from grand cities. The place was never larger than five hectares even at its peak but unearthed a massive private structure enclosing a grand audience chamber, living quarters, storage areas, and an armory. The assemblage of finely crafted swords and spearheads signals the owner’s control over violence.
