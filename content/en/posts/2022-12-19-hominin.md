As I find osteology extremely interesting, I decide to write a special series for osteology based on my notes of [Anth 207x: Introduction to Human Evolution](https://learning.edx.org/course/course-v1:WellesleyX+ANTH207x_2+2T2015/home) lectured by Professor Adam Van Arsdale of Wellesley College. {{<end>}}

Discovered in 2001, Sahelanthropus was found in the desert of the Lake Chad basin in Central Africa.

Why we say that Sahelanthropus mgiht be a member of hominins?  There are several osteological evidence to support this hypothesis :

- **Relatively small canine**. Although the fossil itself does not seem like "small", some scholars argue that this is a male skull and it is relatively small for a male. 
- **Apical wear of tooth**. Form the picture, we can see the tip of the crown is wearing instead of posterior edge, which is quite human-like chewing motion. 
- **Forward positioned foramen magnum**. The relative forward position of the foramen magnum relative to the orbits shows that Sahelanthropus might be bipedal.
