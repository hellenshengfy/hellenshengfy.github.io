# Archaeologists
  
| Year | Name | Zooarchaeological results on cattle|
|---------|---------|---------|
| 1960s | James Mellaart | Cattle constitutes 70% of the faunal assemblage which might be biased because of hand collection |
| 1993 | Ian Hodder | Cattle constitute 20-25% of the faunal assemblage and there is no indication of domestication of cattle|

# Animals in Çatalhöyük

1. Domesticated: 

        1.1 Sheep and goat (Sheep: of confidence; goat: most likely) 
            - Numerically dominated in animal bones.   
            - Slaughtered as juveniles or subadults
            - Wool / dairy products of little importance. 
            - Consuming pattern : highly processed (smashed & boiled for grease) for domestic activities most likely
            - Absent in symbolic context

         1.2 Dog

2. Wild （symbolic) :

        2.1 Cattle (Special context) 
            - Famous for architectural installations and in the caches. Mellaart recorded three variants of installations:
                1. frontlets (horn cores and the intervening skull) set in plaster heads attached to walls; 
                2. frontlets set in small pillars along the edges of platforms; 
                3. pairs of horns set into benches. 
            — Consuming pattern: Feasting remaining (large intact joint, not smashed, most likely to be roasted in open area)

        2.2 Bird 
            - Rare in feasting deposit, a few appear in burial
            - Cranes: in dancing postures; vultures swooping at headless human figures (carrying soul to the heaven)

        2.3 Pig: Maybe taboo in later levels: forbidden to certain groups of people/ not allowed to be eaten on site 
  
3. Deer: Appear prominently in wall paintings of later period (symbolic importance)
  
4. One wild large horse (wild horses were thought to be extinct in Anatolia in Neolithic time) 
  
5. Fox/Badger/Wolf/Hare
