As I find osteology extremely interesting, I decide to write a special series for osteology based on my notes of [Anth 207x: Introduction to Human Evolution](https://learning.edx.org/course/course-v1:WellesleyX+ANTH207x_2+2T2015/home) lectured by Professor Adam Van Arsdale of Wellesley College. {{<end>}}

Being bipedality is a tremendous shift. It involves changes of entire skeleton: 

# **Femur**: 

## 1. Bicondylar angle 

Being bipedal means we walk on one leg for every step and this means great weight and pressure on our legs. In order to solve this issue, our skeleton creates a ***bicondylar angle***, which helps to bring our weight closer to our midline.

The bicondylar angle is the angle between the midline of the femoral shaft (purple) and the perpendicular line (blue) to the plane created by the femoral condyles (black). If we contrast our femur with a chimp's femur, we will notice that the chimp's femur would be more straight as they're quadrupeds, i.e. they do not load the weight on a single leg and thus do not need that angle to for bone protection.


## 2. Long femur neck and muscular attachment sites

Bicondylar angle, on the one hand, means that the distal femur is medially displaced; on the other, it also means the proximal is laterally positoned. To achieve this, we need a long femur neck. Besides, strong muscles are required to stabilize the pelvis and the hips in bipedal locomotion. There are many big muscular attachment sites at the proximal end of the femur.

## 3. Asymmetrical pattern of bone distribution

In a CT scan, we expect an asymmetrical pattern of human bone distribution and more symmetrically distributed bone in chimps. This is also becasue of the fact that we load forces on our legs from limited angles over and over agian while chimps loads femur in various angles.
