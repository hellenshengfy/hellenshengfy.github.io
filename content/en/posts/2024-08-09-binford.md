# Chapter 1: Glossary

## 1. Archaeological glossary

 **(1) Coarse-grained assemblage**

An assemblage that is the accumulated product of events spanning an entire year is rather gross and may be referred to as coarse-grained in that the resolution between archaeological remains and specific events is poor. 


 **(2) Fine-grained assemblage**

An assemblage accumulated over a short period of time, for instance a two-day camp, represents a fine-grained resolution between debris or by-products and events.


## 2. The glossary put forward by Binford



 **(1) Three strategies**

An assemblage accumulated over a short period of time, for instance a two-day camp, represents a fine-grained resolution between debris or by-products and events.

**A. "Mapping on" strategies:** 

"Map on" by moving consumers to resources with frequent residential moves. This strategy would work only if all the critical resources were within foraging range of a residential base.

**B. Logistical strategies:** 

Move resources to consumers "logistically" with generally fewer residential moves. 

**C. An alternative strategy:**

May be executed occasionally by peoples who are basically foragers. We might think of this as a hunting trip where several men leave a residential establishing overnight camps from which they move out in search of game, frequently using what I (Binford 1978b) have termed an encounter of strategy. If they succeed in their hunting endeavors, and if the body size of the animal is large or the distance to camp is great and the temperature is warm, they may elect to dry the meat in the field and transport processed meat back to camp. They may then elect to return to the base by the original route or, if more meat is needed, they are more likely to return by a new route where they may even have further success in hunting. This little hunting trip represents a different type of strategy. It is a specialized work party, in this case made up of men, who establish camps for their own maintenance away from the residential base camp where they live. They may conduct special activities which may be only very rarely conducted in the residential base camp. This type of strategy may leave a very different kind of archaeological record 


 **(2) Two issues**

**A. Spatial incongruity:**

The situation where consumers are near to one critical resource but far from another equally critical resource.

Logistical strategies solve the problem of an incongruous distribution among critical resources (i.e., the lack of a reliable supply of a critical resource within the foraging radius of a residential base camp presumably located with regard to an equally critical resource).

Under conditions of spatial incongruity it must be appreciated that a residential move will not solve the problem. A move toward one location reduces the access to the other. It is under this condition that a logistical strategy is favored.

**B. Temporal incongruity:**

A storage strategy is the most likely means of solving the problem. One seeks to extend the time utility for one of the resources beyond its period of availability in the habitat. This is accomplished generally by either drying or freezing. 

Storage reduces incongruous temporal phasing of resources, but it may increase the problem of spatial incongruity.



 **(2) Fine-grained assemblage**

An assemblage accumulated over a short period of time, for instance a two-day camp, represents a fine-grained resolution between debris or by-products and events.

When discussing the origin of the state, The Dawn of Everything gave a very different answer: there is no origin of the state at all!

It is 
- NOT a constant of history
- NOT the result of a long evolutionary process that began in the Bronze Age
- BUT a confluence of three political forms – sovereignty, administration and charismatic competition – that have different origins.

Moreover, the emergence of modern states was not an inevitable outcome, because modern states are simply a combination of three principles of domination. The power of kings, bureaucracies, and charismatic competition are reinterpreted as manifestations of “the people“, “the nation“, “democracy“ and “election”.
 
{{<block class="Caution">}}
However, it's important to critically assess the evidence provided by the book.

The book quotes:
"As we noted, there are now planetary bureaucracies (public and private, ranging from the IMF and WTO to J. P. Morgan Chase and various credit-rating agencies) without anything that resembles a corresponding principle of global sovereignty or global field of competitive politics; and everything from cryptocurrencies to private security agencies, undermining the sovereignty of states......Where we once assumed‘civilization’ and ‘state’ to be conjoined entities that came down to us as a historical package...... what history now demonstrates is that these terms actually refer to complex amalgams of elements which have entirely different origins and which are currently in the process of drifting apart."

The thing is economic entity is a totally different thing compared to political ones. Drawing parallels between them may not be entirely appropriate, as they belong to different categories by nature.  You can not use examples of J. P. Morgan Chase to proof anything on politics. Comparing them to argue against the inevitability of modern states is akin to comparing apples and oranges and declaring that “See, apple is not inevitable because banana is there too! And they are both fruits.”

Here you can notice that three political forms mentioned above is exactly three elementary forms of dominance:the control of violence, the control of information, and individual charisma.


{{<block class="note">}}
The distinction between the control of violence (sovereign), and individual charisma (heroic order) lies in the fact that warrior’s honor is based on the fact that he might lose the honour, leading them to be willing to stake their lives to protect it. In contrast, rulers who control violence do not perceive themselves as heroic figures and they initiate wars to assert their ownership.

## Human societies under new category

### First-Order Regimes

**1. Olmec**
   
| Elementary forms of dominance | Y/N |
|---------|---------|
| The control of violence | N | 
| The control of information | N| 
| Individual charisma | Y | 

Olmec is an “empire”built on spectacle, competition and personal attributes of political leaders.

- Clearly marked elites
Although marked by grand pyramids and monuments, Olmec rulers did not command a stable military or administrative apparatus.  Instead,they presided over a remarkable spread of cultural influence and in the form of images distributed on vessels and objects 

- Battles and games formed part of an annual cycle of royal competitions evidenced by:
  
  a. Colossal sculpted head wearing the leather helmets of ball players

  {{<figure src="https://hellenshengfy.github.io/dawn_20.jpg" title="Olmec Sculpted Head">}}

  Note: online photo from [here](https://www.thoughtco.com/facts-about-the-ancient-olmec-2136305)

  b. Its great influence on later Mesoamerican civilizations:
      -  A chief Maya gods were themselves ball players
      -  Bird Jaguar the Great appears as a ball player on the inscribed staircase at Yaxchilan

**2. Chavín Horizon before the Inca**

| Elementary forms of dominance | Y/N |
|---------|---------|
| The control of violence | N | 
| The control of information | Y | 
| Individual charisma | N | 

Chavin is an “empire”built on images linked to esoteric knowledge.

From 1000 BC to 200 BC, the 'Chavín horizon,' centered at Chavín de Huántar, extended its influence over the northwest of South America. The militarized polity Wari occupied the central highlands; the metropolis Tiwanaku, roughly twice the size of Uruk or Mohenjo-daro, was established on the shores of Lake Titicaca; and the Moche, displaying evidence of female leadership, resided on the north coast of Peru.

 {{<figure src="https://hellenshengfy.github.io/dawn_22.jpg" title="The Map from My Notes">}}

Chavín art is not composed of pictures or a photographic writing system. The human faces with snake-like fangs and other images serve more like a 'memory palace,' aiding in the memorization of stories, speeches, and histories.

  Note: online photo from [here](https://www.alamy.es/cabezas-clavas-chavin-de-huantar-image223195188.html)

The absence of obvious fortifications or administrative quarters suggests a focus on ritual performance, exemplified by structures like temples and the renowned El Lanzón.

**3. Natchez**

| Elementary forms of dominance | Y/N |
|---------|---------|
| The control of violence | Y | 
| The control of information | N | 
| Individual charisma | N | 


Based on written records and archaeological records, we know that, for the Natchez of Louisiana:

a. The ruler enjoyed absolute power of command but had minimal bureaucracy.

People should bow and wail before the ruler and even king’s wives were not allowed to share meal with him.

b. The ruler is called “the great sun” and settled in the isolated Great Palace in the Great Village, where he enjoyed great power. Ordinary Natchez just move away from the proximity of the Great sun to avoid the control of the ruler.

**4. Shilluk**

| Elementary forms of dominance | Y/N |
|---------|---------|
| The control of violence | Y | 
| The control of information | N | 
| Individual charisma | N | 


The Shilluk people live alongside the Nuer in South Sudan. The  Nuer people occupy lands fit for cattle-grazing and lead a life of egalitarian, while the Shilluk live along the White Nile and grow the local grain called durra.

 {{<figure src="https://hellenshengfy.github.io/dawn_26.jpg" title="The Map from My Notes">}}

 {{<figure src="https://hellenshengfy.github.io/dawn_27.jpg" title="The Map from the Book">}}

 Unlike the Nuer, the Shilluk had a king (the reth), but with limited power.

a. The reth resided in an isolated capital, where he conducted regular rituals to guarantee fertility and well-being.

b. The reth could act with total impunity, but his authority was largely limited to those in their immediate presence.

c. Whenever a reth attempted to set up an administrative apparatus, his actions were met with resistance.

### Second-Order Regimes

**1. Egypt**
   
| Elementary forms of dominance | Y/N |
|---------|---------|
| The control of violence | Y | 
| The control of information | Y | 
| Individual charisma | N | 

During the period of the Great Pyramids, bread and beer were manufactured on an industrial scale to supply armies of workers during seasonal service on royal construction projects. People of Old Kingdom Egypt made huge communal loaves known as “bedja bread,” which were eaten in large groups with meat and beer supplied by the royal household, serving as an important aspect of solidarity for work crews. These seasonal work units (phyles) seem to have been comprised only of men who passed through special age-grade rituals and modeled themselves on the organization of a boat's crew.

Egypt is often considered as the first true state for several reasons:

- Chronologically the earliest example of second-order regimes of domination
- Capable of synthesizing absolute sovereignty with an administrative apparatus. 
- Only heroic, competitive politics were absent, pushed off into the worlds of gods and the dead. 
- The only case where sovereignty and administration came together, fitting the model of what should have happened during that distant phase of history

Unlike the Shang China whose rulers were accompanied to the afterlife by a few important retainers and sacrificial victims (to prevent others from becoming ancestors), the first Egyptian kings are indeed buried with victims drawn almost exclusively from their own inner circles. Just like what the authors wrote: **a ritual designed to produce kinship becomes a method of producing kingship**.

{{<block class="warning">}}
Dark Ages refer to periods when authority broke down, such as the First Intermediate Period. The authors warn us that it is also the period when heroic politics return, marking a transition from the people's reverence for god-like rulers to the overlords’care of the people as a legitimate path to authority. Significant political accomplishments occur in precisely those periods and often get dismissed because no one was building grandiose monuments in stone.

**2. Cahokia**
   
| Elementary forms of dominance | Y/N |
|---------|---------|
| The control of violence | Y | 
| The control of information | N | 
| Individual charisma | Y | 


The Mississippian city of Cahokia is thought to be the first state in America.

 {{<figure src="https://hellenshengfy.github.io/dawn_29.jpg" title="The Map from My Notes">}}

  Social hierarchies emerged, evidenced by the disappearance of chunkey discs from ordinary burials. From the summit of Monk’s Mound, the city’s ruling elite enjoyed powers of surveillance over residential zones and spent their time competing in chunkey tournaments. More strikingly, there was a complete dismantling of any self-governing communities outside the city.

### Third-Order Regimes

**Modern states**


| Elementary forms of dominance | Y/N |
|---------|---------|
| The control of violence | Y | 
| The control of information | Y | 
| Individual charisma | Y | 


As I mentioned before, modern states are a combination of three principles of domination. 

The power of kings, bureaucracies, and charismatic competition are reinterpreted as manifestations of “the people“, “the nation“, “democracy“ and “election”.
