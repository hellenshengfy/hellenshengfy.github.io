Hominids, Hominioid, Hominines and Hominins? When I first come up with these terms, I was quite confused and found it hard to distinguish one from the other. After reading the paper *Human Evolution: Taxonomy and Paleobiology*, I decide to write this article and introduce you these terms under new taxonomic classification system which based on molecular evidence.

First of all, let me show you the chart, to make things easier. This chart is drawn based on the taxonomy table illustrated in *Human Evolution: Taxonomy and Paleobiology*.

I also find the family tree on the website of [The Smithsonian Institution's Human Origins Program](https://humanorigins.si.edu/evidence/human-family-tree) quite informative. {{<end>}}
  
Now we could tell the correct sequence of these terms, from the broadest to the narrowest: **Hominoidea [Hominoids] - Hominidae [Hominids] -Homininae [Hominines] - Hominini [Hominins]**. 

- **Hominoidea [Hominoids]** is the broadest term and is a superfamily including humans, the gibbons, and the great apes (orangutan, chimpanzee, and gorilla).

- **Hominidae [Hominids]** excludes the gibbons, and is a family including orangutans, gorillas, chimps and humans.

- **Homininae [Hominines]** further excludes orangutans and gorillas, and is a subfamily including chimps and humans. Homininae shows the close relationship of humans and chimps.

- **Hominini [Hominins]** is the subfamily we humans belongs to,

Note: Many people say that chimps are our ancestors. However, this is a misunderstanding. As we can see from the chart above, Pan is the sister clay to Homos. The development history of chimps since the seperation of our common ancestor is as long as human beings.
