As I find osteology extremely interesting, I decide to write a special series for osteology based on my notes of [Anth 207x: Introduction to Human Evolution](https://learning.edx.org/course/course-v1:WellesleyX+ANTH207x_2+2T2015/home) lectured by Professor Adam Van Arsdale of Wellesley College. {{<end>}}

# Less curved tibia

Compared with the chimp's tibia, human tibia is less curved and less flexed. This is because we human beings exclusively load our tibia from an anterior/posterior direction but chimps ***knuckwalk quadrupedally***. Chimps do a lot of different activities where tibia get involved like climing the tree. As a result, they developed a more flexed shaft.

# Bowl-like pelvis

Human beings developed bowl-like pelvis to support our upper body in bipedal locomotion and stablize the lower body. This shape also frees up our lumbar vertebrae, providing more room and flexbility for it. In contrast, other ape's vertebrae are bracketed by the superior portion of the os coxae. 

# Others

- Humans are of lower ratio of arm length to leg length. 
- Humans have relatively shorter fingers and longer thumbs. 
- Humans have an adducted hallux. 
- Huamn toes are locked in position with little movement capabilities. They are designed to help maintain balance.
