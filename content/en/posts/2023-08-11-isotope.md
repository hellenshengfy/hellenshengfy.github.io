To explain "why do C3 plants and C4 plants differ in stable carbon isotope", let us start from *photosynthesis* and *photorespiration* first.

# Photosynthesis and Photorespiration
  
For a normal carbon fixation process, Rubisco will bind CO2 to facilitate photosynthesis. However, Rubisco sometimes adds O2 to RuBP instead of CO2 if a high concentration of O2 in the cell is expected. This results in photorespiration that is toxic to the plant growth.

To minimize photorespiration, C3 plants, C4 plants and CAM (Crassulacean Acid Metabolism) plants develops different strategies for better environment adaptation.

## C3 plants

They live in wet and cold environment, and they keep stomata open to minimize photorespiration. By doing this, C3 plants can absorb co2 and release O2 at the same time. C3 plants will generate a 3-carbon compound (*Calvin-Benson photosynthetic pathway*). The photosynthesis is carried out in the mesophyll cells. C3 carbon fixation is the most common pathway of photosynthesis.

C3 plants include Potato, soybeans, wheat, rice, oats and etc.

## C4 plants and CAM plants

C4 plants live in dry and hot environment while CAM plants live in arid environment. Both environments prevent them from opening stomata for a long time because this will lead to water loss. These two kinds of plants avoid photorespiration by separating carbon fixation process and Calvin Cycle to ensure that the carbon level is high enough for photosynthesis.

- C4 plants separate the carbon fixation process and Calvin Cycle **by space**. They first fix CO2 into 4-carbon compound using PEP carboxylase (*Hatch-Slack photosynthetic  pathway*) in mesophyll cells and then cycle the compound into bundle sheath cells where CO2 is released and concentrated for Calvin Cycle.

Therefore, mesophyll cells in C4 plants are not specialized for different functions.

C3 plants include maize, millet and etc.

 - CAM plants separate the carbon fixation process and Calvin Cycle **by time**. At night, they open stomata to fix CO2 into 4-carbon compound just like C4 plants do and then store them in vacuole. During day time, they close stomata to conserve water and release carbon stored for Calvin Cycle.

CAM plants include pineapples, aloe, succulents and etc.


# ∂C13 of C3, C4 and CAM plants

To sum up, C3, C4 and CAM plants have different photosynthesis pathways as illustrated below.

And this leads to the difference in isotope information of these plants. Recall that C12 is lighter than C13 and preferred in photosynthesis.

Discrimination against C13 (∂C13) is thus more negative ∂C13 for C3 plants which reflects their greater (direct) usage of the lighter C12O2 in Calvin-Benson photosynthetic pathway. Generally, terrestrial C4 plants have ∂C13 value of −9‰ to −16‰ while terrestrial C3 plants have ∂C13 value of −23‰ to −30‰.

For CAM plants, ∂C13 varies according to the amount of daytime CO2 fixation by Rubisco thus their ∂C13 values are less negative[1].
