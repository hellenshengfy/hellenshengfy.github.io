To understand "why do C3 plants and C4 plants differ in stable carbon isotope", we need to know photosynthesis pathways first.

For a normal carbon fixation process, Rubisco will bind CO2 to facilitate photosynthesis. However, Rubisco sometimes adds O2 to RuBP instead of CO2 if a high concentration of O2 in the cell is expected. This results in photorespiration that is toxic to the plant growth.

To minimize photorespiration, C3 plants, C4 plants and CAM plants  (Crassulacean Acid Metabolism) develops different strategies.

C3 plants: They live in wet and cold environment, and they keep stomata open. 
By doing this, C3 plants can absorb co2 and release O2 at the same time. C3 plants will generate a 3-carbon compound. The photosynthesis is carried out in the mesophyll cells.
C3 carbon fixation is the most common pathway of photosynthesis.
Includes Potato, Soybeans, wheat, rice and oats

 C4 plants and CAM plants:  C4 plants live in dry and hot environment while CAM plants live in arid environment. Both environments prevent them from opening stomata for a long time because this will lead to water loss. These two kinds of plants avoid photorespiration by separating carbon fixation process and Calvin Cycle to ensure the carbon level is high enough for photosynthesis.

- C4 plants separate the carbon fixation process and Calvin Cycle by space. They first fix co2 into 4-carbon compound using PEP carboxylase in mesophyll cells and then cycle the compound into bundle sheath cells where CO2 is released and concentrated for Calvin Cycle. Therefore, there is no specialization in mesophyll cells in C4 plants anymore.

 - CAM plants separate the carbon fixation process and Calvin Cycle by time. At night, they open stomata to fix co2 into 4-carbon compound and store them in vacuole. During day time, they close stomata to conserve water and release carbon stored for Calvin Cycle.

Discrimination against C13 is commonly designated ∂C13 when comparing carbon isotopes in plant tissues (discrimination is relative to a fossil belemnite standard); the units are generally parts per thousand (parts per mil), symbolized by ‰. In this unit, ∂C13 is generally −10‰ to −15‰ for C4 plants and −20‰ to −30‰ for C3 plants; the more negative ∂C13 for C3 plants reflects their greater (direct) usage of the lighter C12O2. For CAM plants, ∂C13 varies according to the amount of daytime CO2 fixation by Rubisco (e.g., early morning CO2 uptake by the CAM species Agave deserti, Fig. 8-22, occurs in the C3 mode); thus their ∂C13 values are less negative (similar to C4 species) when soil water is limiting because then CO2 uptake occurs primarily at night.
