I worked as a financial analyst to facilitate fund raising of the global market. I collaberate with international teams to issue offshore bond demoninated in a range of currencies (USD/EUR/HKD/SGD/CHY). My responsibilities encompassed financial model building, financial product pricing, financial statement spreading, legal document checking, government bond bidding and more. Basically, I dealt with issues related to math, law, and market.

I enjoyed my time in the museums and the field even more. In 2019, I backpacked around Europe and visited over 20 museums there, adding depth and breadth to my cultural understanding. In 2023, I had the opportunity to excavate a neolithic site in China, where I felt immense satisfaction and freedom. Holding a potsherd in my hand, I felt a connection to thousands of years ago, a feeling unlike anything I had experienced before.
