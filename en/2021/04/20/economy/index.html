Here is an excerpt from that paper. I used auto-regression model to prove the negative influence of bitcoin.</p><h1 id=negative-impacts-ofblockchain-technology-application-on-stock-market-operation-system>Negative Impacts of Blockchain Technology Application on Stock Market Operation System<a href=#negative-impacts-ofblockchain-technology-application-on-stock-market-operation-system class=header-anchor arialabel=Anchor> #</a></h1><h2 id=31-lack-of-identity-verification>3.1 Lack of Identity Verification<a href=#31-lack-of-identity-verification class=header-anchor arialabel=Anchor> #</a></h2><p>At present, the traditional stock trading system consists of four segments: account opening, commissioning, transactions matching, and settlement and confirmation. To start with, investors need to open a stock account and a capital account at the brokerage firm and designate a bank as the third-party to ensure the security of funds and stocks. After account opening, brokerage firms will make all transactions on behalf of investors in exchange of commission and transaction fee. Besides, the existing rules require securities companies to revisit at least one percent of their new customers in a month, which also helps to guarantee the account identification.
In the exchange hours, investors give orders to their brokers after making investment decisions based on market information and personal judgment. And brokerage must verify the investors’ account first to decide whether to accept the transaction commission or not. Once the order is accepted, it will be sent into exchange system to find a counterpart of the trade on a certain price. Usually, this counterpart is an institutional investor or another similar investor who opens an account and makes investment under the help of his broker.
The setting of the transaction price is divided into periodic auction and continuous auction. All investors need to bid or offer their price to the system in the first place. Under the principle of time priority and price priority, the exchange matches buyers and sellers automatically. Then the transaction will be confirmed by the system after the transaction price is set, namely, settling buyers and sellers’ account and the ownership of the stock.
To conclude, although the existing system is relatively more complicated and has many problems, it ensures connection between reality and network, through which investors can trade with a counterpart in reality and facilitate the confirmation of rights and responsibilities.</p><h2 id=32-expansibility-and-dependence>3.2 Expansibility and Dependence<a href=#32-expansibility-and-dependence class=header-anchor arialabel=Anchor> #</a></h2><p>Useless information, accounting costs and the huge number of redundant chains within the system are great flaws in blockchain technology. The accounting ability of blockchain technology is achieved by the effort of miners, from which the cost of accounting derives. Currently, the minimum transaction cost is 0.0001 Bitcoin (approximately $ 0.04). It fluctuates with the change of value of Bitcoin. Miners have the right to receive a mining fee for transaction in which only small amount of money is involved. And this rule causes enormous accounting cost when the system is applied into stock market, where numerous transactions are traded in the primary market and the secondary market. In particular, since the blocks in the system, in order to achieve the authenticity of the information, can no longer be deleted or rewritten even if it contains false information, blockchain will expand uncontrollably and cause great pressure on the system itself.
In addition, blockchain technology and Bitcoin show an interdependent relationship. On the one hand, the blockchain technology can only be applied into the stock market with special carriers like Bitcoin. And Bitcoin itself has become a vehicle of investment in the market. On the other hand, unlike other electronic money, Bitcoin relies on blockchain technology, and its release is entirely determined by computer. This innate virtuality with the addition of investors’ skepticism towards blockchain technology can explain the volatility of it. In order to prove the volatility of Bitcoin, this paper carries out the following empirical test.</p><h2 id=321-data-selection>3.2.1 Data selection<a href=#321-data-selection class=header-anchor arialabel=Anchor> #</a></h2><p>This empirical test is based on data from www.blockchain.info concerning the price of Bitcoin over 60 days in the United States. The test processes the daily return logarithmically to better reflect the volatility of the data:

Although the data fluctuates greatly, sample mean is around zero.</p><h2 id=322-adf-unit-root-test>3.2.2 ADF Unit Root Test<a href=#322-adf-unit-root-test class=header-anchor arialabel=Anchor> #</a></h2><p>The ADF unit root test is performed on the time series of logarithmic returns to confirm its stationarity and prevent spurious regression.     
The test results show that t values of all coefficient surpass its critical value when the confidence level is set at 95%. Besides, the probability of augmented Dickey-Fuller test equals to 0.0000, which is less than 0.05. Therefore, there is no unit root, and the time series of logarithmic returns is a stationary sequence.</p><h2 id=323-modeling>3.2.3 Modeling<a href=#323-modeling class=header-anchor arialabel=Anchor> #</a></h2><p>The correlation test is performed on the log daily returns basis, and the lag order and model are determined by the test. The correlation results are shown in Figure A3:</p><figure itemprop=associatedMedia itemscope itemtype=http://schema.org/ImageObject><a href=https://hellenshengfy.github.io/bitcoin4.png itemprop=contentUrl><img itemprop=thumbnail src=https://hellenshengfy.github.io/bitcoin4.png></a><figcaption><h4>Figure A3: Correlation Test Result</h4></figcaption></figure><p>Correlation test result tells that logarithmic returns of Bitcoin has 1, 2, 5, 13, 19, 21th lag orders. Accordingly, the model is set as follows:</p><p><figure itemprop=associatedMedia itemscope itemtype=http://schema.org/ImageObject><a href=https://hellenshengfy.github.io/bitcoin5.png itemprop=contentUrl><img itemprop=thumbnail src=https://hellenshengfy.github.io/bitcoin5.png></a></figure>（2）</p><p>Afterwards, auto-regression estimation is carried out.</p><p>Auto-regression estimation determines the model as:</p><figure itemprop=associatedMedia itemscope itemtype=http://schema.org/ImageObject><a href=https://hellenshengfy.github.io/bitcoin6.png itemprop=contentUrl><img itemprop=thumbnail src=https://hellenshengfy.github.io/bitcoin6.png></a></figure><p>The model above shows that, although the R-squared (0.25) is relatively low, the volatility and dependence of the Bitcoin is quite obvious. The 21th lag order of the model indicates that the historical information still exerts an important impact on the price of today. Apart from the empirical analysis, in January 2009, Nakamoto dug the first batch of Bitcoin when the value of a Bitcoin was less than $ 0.05. Later, its value reached $ 1 in 2011 but it never exceeded 12 dollars until 2014. However, with the popularization of Bitcoin, its value continues to make new historical record: the value of Bitcoin reached $ 20 at the beginning of 2013 and $ 266 in April; in 2014, a Bitcoin is sold 1240 dollars.
Meanwhile, its great yield and excellent performance attract more and more investors. The number of investors increases from hundreds at the beginning of the year of 2009 to nearly 10 million people now. At the same time, Bitcoin also gave birth to a lot of Bitcoin related business and increased the number of the participants in the securities market. Nevertheless, when Bitcoin thrived, Mt.Gox, largest Bitcoin trading platform in the world of this kind, bankrupted after 500,000 Bitcoin was stolen in February 2014. This case caused a panic in the market and disagreement on the value of Bitcoin appeared. Accordingly, the Bitcoin price decreased sharply to about $ 400. And on April 7, 2016, the value of Bitcoin remained $ 422.
Hence, both empirical analysis and historical performance of Bitcoin show that the virtuality and dependency are two fatal defects of Bitcoin and they give a blow to the confidence of the market on the blockchain technology.</p><h2 id=33-anonymity-and-virtuality>3.3 Anonymity and Virtuality<a href=#33-anonymity-and-virtuality class=header-anchor arialabel=Anchor> #</a></h2><p>Although the blockchain technology can solve distrust problem within the system perfectly, it has two very obvious shortcoming&mdash;anonymity and virtuality. blockchain technology functions in a way that public key and private key play an important role instead of the identity verification of each node. It does not require authentic identities when accounts are opened. After uploading necessary information and applying for an account online, all participants can start a trade by a click of mouse. Users have the freedom to trade anonymously and they have no idea about who they are trading with, which increase the risk of black market and money laundering.
As the information on the blocks is interlocked with each other by Hash value, once black money flows in the blockchain system, all participants and blocks that enter the system afterwards, whether informed or not, are connected with the black money. Therefore, it will ask for millions users’ identity to be verified in order to find the person who starts money laundering. Hence, the blockchain technology makes the identity verification become more complex and black market and money laundering easier.
Furthermore, in the securities market, it is quite crucial for investors to choose a proper investment vehicle. But anonymity cuts the relation between information and its owners. And many investors will hesitate for a long time before they have deeper understanding of the investment vehicles because they are not sure on which entity they are investing. In addition, many investment vehicles of good performance can hardly get enough investment and attention if they are traded anonymously from the very beginning. Thus, to some extent, anonymity and virtuality also deter transactions.
All in all, as the virtual world is not a perfect substitute for the real life, blockchain technology can not completely replace the traditional intermediary institutions. The market still needs securities companies, exchanges and other institutions to verify the identity of the traders and promote transactions in the real world.</p><p style=color:#777>Last modified on 2021-04-20</p></div><a href=#top><i class="fa fa-chevron-up" style=font-size:30px;color:#000></i></a></main><footer class=footer><script type=text/javascript src=/js/math-code.js></script><script async src="//mathjax.rstudio.com/latest/MathJax.js?config=TeX-MML-AM_CHTML"></script><script type=text/javascript src=/js/center-img.js></script><ul class=footer-links><li><a href=/en/posts/index.xml type=application/rss+xml title="RSS feed">Subscribe</a></li><li><a href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/ target=_blank>License
