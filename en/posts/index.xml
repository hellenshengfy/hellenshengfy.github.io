So I spent my spare time reading articles and attending online courses (Genome Sequencing and DNA Decoded ) about DNA. I hope this article could help you know more about DNA.
Ancient DNA has been increasingly important in the field of archaeology. It is a code book which tells the life story of people, animal, plant and even bacteria.</description></item><item><title>My latest writing sample:Zooarchaeological Data Tell Stories of the Kuahuqiao</title><link>https://hellenshengfy.github.io/en/2023/10/05/dna/</link><pubDate>Thu, 05 Oct 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://hellenshengfy.github.io/en/2023/10/05/dna/</guid><description>This is the pdf of my latest paper Zooarchaeological Data Tell Stories of the Kuahuqiao</description></item><item><title>How to draw archaeological map using ArcGIS 10.5</title><link>https://hellenshengfy.github.io/en/2023/09/25/cfa/</link><pubDate>Mon, 25 Sep 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://hellenshengfy.github.io/en/2023/09/25/cfa/</guid><description>My mannual book to draw archaeological map using ArcGIS 10.5 based on introductory course of Dr. Li Wei (Fudan University).

To explain &amp;ldquo;why do C3 plants and C4 plants differ in stable carbon isotope&amp;rdquo;, let us start from photosynthesis and photorespiration first.
Photosynthesis and Photorespiration For a normal carbon fixation process, Rubisco will bind CO2 to facilitate photosynthesis. However, Rubisco sometimes adds O2 to RuBP instead of CO2 if a high concentration of O2 in the cell is expected.</description></item><item><title> Majiabang Culture (7000-6000 years ago)</title><link>https://hellenshengfy.github.io/en/2023/07/29/majiabang/</link><pubDate>Sat, 29 Jul 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://hellenshengfy.github.io/en/2023/07/29/majiabang/</guid><description>Photos credit to presentation material of Mr. Rui Guoyao.

The statistical table in the paper:
And the interpretation of the table goes like this:
&amp;hellip;..positive skew in the distribution&amp;hellip;..negative kurtosis&amp;hellip;.
Unfortunately, the analysis on the skewness and kuitosis might be problematic.
(1) If the mean score is less than the median, it is a negative skew instead of a positive one.
(2) A positive kurtosis expresses the great number of neutral proverbs concentrated around the median, instead of a negative one.</description></item><item><title>Notes on A History of Sea Ice in the Canadian Arctic Archipelago Based on Postglacial Remains of the Bowhead Whale (Balaena mysticetus)</title><link>https://hellenshengfy.github.io/en/2023/06/10/problems/</link><pubDate>Sat, 10 Jun 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://hellenshengfy.github.io/en/2023/06/10/problems/</guid><description>This is my note on A History of Sea Ice in the Canadian Arctic Archipelago Based on Postglacial Remains of the Bowhead Whale (Balaena mysticetus) by S.

Archaeologists can distinguish different types of phytoliths according to their shapes. However, further anaylsis is confined by the fact that, in most cases, a specific shape of phytoliths does not correspond to a specific plant species. Therefore, the picture drawn by phytoliths could be quite vague.

Linear transformation is a transformation that
(1) Keeps lines to be lines after being transformd
(2) With Origin fixed
So these transformations are not linear.

Less curved tibia Compared with the chimp&amp;rsquo;s tibia, human tibia is less curved and less flexed. This is because we human beings exclusively load our tibia from an anterior/posterior direction but chimps knuckwalk quadrupedally. Chimps do a lot of different activities where tibia get involved like climing the tree.</description></item><item><title>How does bipedality influence our skeleton: femur_Osteology (3)</title><link>https://hellenshengfy.github.io/en/2022/11/30/osteology/</link><pubDate>Wed, 30 Nov 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://hellenshengfy.github.io/en/2022/11/30/osteology/</guid><description>As I find osteology extremely interesting, I decide to write a special series for osteology based on my notes of Anth 207x: Introduction to Human Evolution lectured by Professor Adam Van Arsdale of Wellesley College.
Being bipedality is a tremendous shift. It involves changes of entire skeleton:
Femur: 1. Bicondylar angle Being bipedal means we walk on one leg for every step and thus great weight and pressure on our legs.</description></item><item><title>Anth 207x: Dating method</title><link>https://hellenshengfy.github.io/en/2022/11/26/dating-method/</link><pubDate>Sat, 26 Nov 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://hellenshengfy.github.io/en/2022/11/26/dating-method/</guid><description>I really like the edX course Anth 207x: Introduction to Human Evolution lectured by Professor Adam Van Arsdale of Wellesley College, and I took a series of notes to this course.

Relative dating method 1.Geo-chronology: Correlate the age of different sedimentary layers across locations, particularly distinctive sedimentary layers like volcanic ash falls
2.Bio-chronolog: Identify sequences based on fossils contained within these layers. For example, specific fossils are found across different locations.</description></item><item><title>How eating habit impacts skull_osteology (2)</title><link>https://hellenshengfy.github.io/en/2022/11/25/osteology/</link><pubDate>Fri, 25 Nov 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://hellenshengfy.github.io/en/2022/11/25/osteology/</guid><description>As I find osteology extremely interesting, I decide to write a special series for osteology based on my notes of Anth 207x: Introduction to Human Evolution lectured by Professor Adam Van Arsdale of Wellesley College.

As we talked before that chimps and human being evolve from common ancestor, but how can we know when latest common ancestor (LCA) lived?
The answer lies in the molecular clock. In 1960s, geneticists found that differences in some protein structures were accumulating at a near constant rate through time, which made the time estimation of LCA possible.</description></item><item><title>Anth 207x: Miocene: the age of apes</title><link>https://hellenshengfy.github.io/en/2022/11/06/anth-207x/</link><pubDate>Sun, 06 Nov 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://hellenshengfy.github.io/en/2022/11/06/anth-207x/</guid><description>Miocene (a period between 22 million years ago and 5 million years ago) is sometimes known as &amp;ldquo;The Age of Apes&amp;rdquo;. A great diversity of apes lived on various continents of our planet during Miocene and the environment and the climate of the world was quite different from today.
During Miocene, the Mediterranean Sea used to be an open corridor of ocean during instead of a closed body of water. It thus connected the Atlantic Ocean and the Indian Ocean, allowing tropical forests to grow throughout Eurasia, not limited to tropical regions.</description></item><item><title>Eating habit: canine and honing complex_osteology (1)</title><link>https://hellenshengfy.github.io/en/2022/10/20/osteology/</link><pubDate>Thu, 20 Oct 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://hellenshengfy.github.io/en/2022/10/20/osteology/</guid><description>As I find osteology extremely interesting, I decide to write a special series for osteology based on my notes of Anth 207x: Introduction to Human Evolution lectured by Professor Adam Van Arsdale of Wellesley College.
In order to eat raw meat, apes developed strong canians together with a honing complex. Honing complex is a complex that (1) the lower canines project into the diastema between the upper canine and the lateral incisor and (2) the upper canine projects into the diastema between the lower canine and the lower third premolar.</description></item><item><title> CFA level II PASSED!</title><link>https://hellenshengfy.github.io/en/2022/10/11/cfa/</link><pubDate>Tue, 11 Oct 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://hellenshengfy.github.io/en/2022/10/11/cfa/</guid><description>After one year&amp;rsquo;s preparation, I finally claimed my CFA level II badge :-)</description></item><item><title>Anth 207x: Is evolution directional?</title><link>https://hellenshengfy.github.io/en/2022/09/03/anth-207xis-evolution-directional/</link><pubDate>Sat, 03 Sep 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://hellenshengfy.github.io/en/2022/09/03/anth-207xis-evolution-directional/</guid><description>I really like the edX course Anth 207x: Introduction to Human Evolution lectured by Professor Adam Van Arsdale of Wellesley College, and I took a series of notes to this course.

However, many people hold the view that (1) chimps are our ancestors and (2) our ancestors look like chimps. These are misunderstandings.
Firstly, as what I wrote in my previous blog, Pan is the sister clay to Homos. Roughly 7 million years ago, chimps and human beings split from evolutionary tree and evolved in their own directions.</description></item><item><title>Y=AX:Essence of linear algebra</title><link>https://hellenshengfy.github.io/en/2021/05/13/second-post/</link><pubDate>Thu, 13 May 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://hellenshengfy.github.io/en/2021/05/13/second-post/</guid><description>I didn&amp;rsquo;t understand eigenvectors and eigenvalues until I watched 3Blue1Brown&amp;rsquo;s videos.
