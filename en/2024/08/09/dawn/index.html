The glossary put forward by Binford<a href=#2-the-glossary-put-forward-by-binford class=header-anchor arialabel=Anchor> #</a></h3><p><strong>(1) Three strategies</strong></p><p>An assemblage accumulated over a short period of time, for instance a two-day camp, represents a fine-grained resolution between debris or by-products and events.</p><p><strong>A. &ldquo;Mapping on&rdquo; strategies</strong></p><p>&ldquo;Map on&rdquo; by moving consumers to resources with frequent residential moves. This strategy would work only if all the critical resources were within foraging range of a residential base.</p><p><strong>B. Logistical strategies</strong></p><p>Move resources to consumers &ldquo;logistically&rdquo; with generally fewer residential moves.</p><p><strong>C. An alternative strategy</strong></p><p>May be executed occasionally by peoples who are basically foragers. It is a hunting trip where several men leave a residential establishing overnight camps from which they move out in search of game. If they succeed in their hunting endeavors, and if the body size of the animal is large or the distance to camp is great and the temperature is warm, they may elect to dry the meat in the field and transport processed meat back to camp. They may then elect to return to the base by the original route or, if more meat is needed, they are more likely to return by a new route where they may even have further success in hunting.</p><p><strong>(2) Two issues</strong></p><p><strong>A. Spatial incongruity</strong></p><p>The situation where consumers are near to one critical resource but far from another equally critical resource.</p><p>Logistical strategies solve the problem of an incongruous distribution among critical resources (i.e., the lack of a reliable supply of a critical resource within the foraging radius of a residential base camp presumably located with regard to an equally critical resource).</p><p>Under conditions of spatial incongruity it must be appreciated that a residential move will not solve the problem. A move toward one location reduces the access to the other. It is under this condition that a logistical strategy is favored.</p><p><strong>B. Temporal incongruity</strong></p><p>A storage strategy is the most likely means of solving the problem. One seeks to extend the time utility for one of the resources beyond its period of availability in the habitat. This is accomplished generally by either drying or freezing.</p><p>Storage reduces incongruous temporal phasing of resources, but it may increase the problem of spatial incongruity.</p><p><strong>(3) Five locations</strong></p><p><strong>A. Residential base</strong></p><p>The hub of subsistence activities, the locus out of which foraging parties originate and where most processing, manufacturing, and maintenance activities take place.</p><p><strong>B. Locations</strong></p><p>A place where extractive tasks are exclusively carried out. Since foragers generally do not stockpile foods or other raw materials, such locations are generally &ldquo;low bulk&rdquo; procurement sites.only limited quantities are procured there during any one episode, and therefore the site is occupied for only a very short period of time.</p><p>Under low-bulk extraction or low redundancy in localization, the archaeological remains of locations may be scattered over the landscape rather than concentrated in recognizable &ldquo;sites.&rdquo;</p><p><strong>C. Field camps</strong></p><p>A temporary operational center for a task group. It is where a task group sleeps, eats, and otherwise maintains itself while away from the residential base. Field camps may be expected to be further differentiated according to the nature of the target resources, so we may expect sheep hunting field camps, caribou-hunting field camps, fishing field camps, etc.</p><p><strong>D. Stations</strong></p><p>Special-purpose task groups are localized when engaged in information gathering, for instance the observation of game movement (see Binford 1978b) or the observation of other humans.</p><p><strong>E. Caches</strong></p><p>Successful procurement of resources by relatively small groups for relatively large groups generally means large bulk. This bulk must be transported to consumers, although it may on occasion serve as the stimulus for repositioning the consumers. In either case there is commonly a temporary storage phase.</p><h2 id=chapter-2-foragers-vs-collectors>Chapter 2: Foragers VS Collectors<a href=#chapter-2-foragers-vs-collectors class=header-anchor arialabel=Anchor> #</a></h2><h3 id=1-foragers-high-residential-mobility--low-logistical-dependence>1.

In temperate and still colder settings, such continuously available food is reduced as a function of decreases in the length of the growing season.</p><h2 id=chapter-4-the-model>Chapter 4: The model<a href=#chapter-4-the-model class=header-anchor arialabel=Anchor> #</a></h2><figure itemprop=associatedMedia itemscope itemtype=http://schema.org/ImageObject><a href=https://hellenshengfy.github.io/bin4.png itemprop=contentUrl><img itemprop=thumbnail src=https://hellenshengfy.github.io/bin4.png></a></figure><p style=color:#777>Last modified on 2024-08-09</p></div><a href=#top><i class="fa fa-chevron-up" style=font-size:30px;color:#000></i></a></main><footer class=footer><script type=text/javascript src=/js/math-code.js></script><script async src="//mathjax.rstudio.com/latest/MathJax.js?config=TeX-MML-AM_CHTML"></script><script type=text/javascript src=/js/center-img.js></script><ul class=footer-links><li><a href=/en/posts/index.xml type=application/rss+xml title="RSS feed">Subscribe</a></li><li><a href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/ target=_blank>License
