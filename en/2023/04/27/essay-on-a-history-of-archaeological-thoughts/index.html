Culture-historical archaeology became undoubtedly the most important method and theory among all. From evolutionary to culture-historical archaeology, this process corresponded to the profound social and economic background in the late nineteen century and the conceptual change of archaeologists by then.</p><h2 id=social-and-economic-background>Social and economic background<a href=#social-and-economic-background class=header-anchor arialabel=Anchor> #</a></h2><p>In 1860s, a century after the commencement of the first Industrial Revolution, the capitalism and technology upgrade exerted deeper and greater influence on the society, resulting in new economic and political landscape, social difficulties and infrastructure development. Each of them contributes to the rise of culture-historical archaeology.</p><p>Firstly, the new economic and political status fostered increasing public interest in ethnicity. Nationalism prevailed within the emerging national states, the legacy of the Napoleon’s conquest. The “sense of group identity” and the “loyalty to a common homeland” were encouraged, in an effort to unite citizens and form an ethnic entity. Meanwhile, intensive competition for resources and markets once again made colonization and border expansion a key to capital accumulation. By identifying ethnic boundaries and emphasizing difference from other ethnic groups, such activities could be easily justified. Thus, the need to find common ground in a nation as well as the difference among nations called for a more comprehensive study on ethnicity and the origins of specific ethnic groups.</p><p>Secondly, social difficulties in 1880s greatly challenged the theories held by evolutionists while encouraging racism at the same time. On the one hand, financial crisis and political chaos, the miserable byproduct of Industrial Revolution, resulted in the declining faith in technology, creativity and progress which put existing evolutionary archaeology in an unfavorable position. On the other, the dominant middle classes turned to racism to safeguard their supremacy when labor movements and unrest became their major headache. They maintained that social difficulties has their foreign causes and the behavior, which is biologically determined, of people from other countries is too different to be united. Consequently, ethnic and racial study became quite an efficient tool to externalize internal conflicts.</p><p>Thirdly, infrastructure constructions serving for faster economic development helped to provide archaeologists with more archaeological record which makes their growing awareness of cultural difference possible. Archaeological research were conducted in vast areas in Europe along with the constructions of infrastructures like roads and factories. Classification and comparison of artifacts collected from different geographical locations caught the attention of archaeologists by then. Archaeologist had the chance to study the features of different groups of people, and were stunned by the complex variations far beyond the understanding of evolutionists. These complex cultural variations enabled archaeologist to come up with a brand new archaeological approach.</p><h2 id=theoretical-contributions-by-archaeologists-before-childe>Theoretical contributions by archaeologists before Childe<a href=#theoretical-contributions-by-archaeologists-before-childe class=header-anchor arialabel=Anchor> #</a></h2><p>Under aforementioned circumstances, it was quite natural to see the conceptual change in archaeology and the appearance of prominent archaeologists who promoted the development of culture-historical archaeology. Before the publication of V. Gordon. Childe&rsquo;s The Dawn of European Civilization in 1925, which provided a detailed model for the approach and distinguished culture-historical method from evolutionary one, there were various archaeologists whose theories were non-negligible and laid foundation for the approach.</p><p>The concept of culture has its origin in Italian and Spanish, referring to the “cultivation of the human mind” and was later studied in works on Kulturgeschichte by German archaeologists like Gustav Klemm in the nineteen century. Fredrich Ratzel also used this term to oppose evolutionary theories and advocated further attention to life of specific groups. To most antievolutionist, they could not turn a blind eye to flaws of evolutionary ideas. For instance, it failed to explain why some cultures evolved quickly while some remained static for a long period. The existence of a &ldquo;universal standard&rdquo; claimed by evolutionists that could be applied to all cultures was heavily doubted. Therefore, in the late nineteen century, accompanied with the falling faith in invention and creativity caused by the social conflicts, diffusing and migration became a more attractive explanation to the development of different cultures. Franz Baos' cultural relativism and historical particularism, in which diffusion &ldquo;played a major role in bringing about change&rdquo;, was valued. The archaeological interest shifted from the focus on &ldquo;successive stage of cultural development&rdquo; to the exploration of “idiosyncratic feature associated with particular ethnic group” .</p><p>Also, it&rsquo;s important to emphasize the prominent contribution made by Oscar Montelius and Gustaf Kossinna to the birth of culture-historical archaeology. Their archaeological methods and theories exerted great influence on V. Gordon. Childe. Well-known by his systematic typology and chronology, Montelius provided a diffusionist explanation to the development of European culture by regarding Middle East as the cradle of achievements and inventions. Later, this diffusionist belief of Middle East origin and chronology method was applied and utilized by Childe in The Dawn of European Civilization. As for Kossinna, despite of his controversial racism and the relation to the Nazi party, no body can deny the fact that his innovative view significantly promoted the culture-historical archaeology and finished the &ldquo;final replacement&rdquo; of evolutionary approach by culture-historical one. It was Kossinna who first came up with the idea that archaeological record could be organized in a mosaic way, which was finally realized and visualized by Chide in his book. Kossinna also stressed the importantce of the study of the lifestyles of human groups and the link between material evidence and written sources in an attempt to identify the ancestors of modern people. These theories were adopted by Childe and eventually helped him to define archaeological culture as &ldquo;certain types of remains constantly recurring together&rdquo;.</p><h2 id=conclusion>Conclusion<a href=#conclusion class=header-anchor arialabel=Anchor> #</a></h2><p>In a nutshell, the development of archaeology theories and methods reflects the history of contemporary and modern times. Culture-historical archaeology was born in an environment full of social changes and turmoil. It is not only the achievement of archaeologists but also the product of the times.</p><p style=color:#777>Last modified on 2023-04-27</p></div><a href=#top><i class="fa fa-chevron-up" style=font-size:30px;color:#000></i></a></main><footer class=footer><script type=text/javascript src=/js/math-code.js></script><script async src="//mathjax.rstudio.com/latest/MathJax.js?config=TeX-MML-AM_CHTML"></script><script type=text/javascript src=/js/center-img.js></script><ul class=footer-links><li><a href=/en/posts/index.xml type=application/rss+xml title="RSS feed">Subscribe</a></li><li><a href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/ target=_blank>License
