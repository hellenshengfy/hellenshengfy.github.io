lectured by Professor Adam Van Arsdale of Wellesley College, and I took a series of notes to this course. This article is based on my notes.</div></p><p>By definition, evolution is “the heritable changes in a population through time”. It seems like that evolution has a direction (for example: from simple to complex), but it is <strong>NOT</strong> the case. To understand this, we need to know four basic forces of evolutionary change: mutation, gene drift, gene flow and natural selection.</p><h2 id=mutation>Mutation<a href=#mutation class=header-anchor arialabel=Anchor> #</a></h2><p>Mutation is the change of an organism’s DNA and thus is cause of variation. There are two types of mutation: point mutation (more common and of minor influence) and chromosomal aberration (rare and of greater impact). Mutation happens randomly, and it is impossible to predict where and when mutation will happen. Thus, most mutations are harmful and neutral, and only a few is beneficial. Deleterious mutation can also cause evolutionary change, especially in small populations. For example, a mutation might cause the extinction of a population if it is happened on individuals of a small group, who carries adaptive alleles.</p><h2 id=gene-drift>Gene drift<a href=#gene-drift class=header-anchor arialabel=Anchor> #</a></h2><p>Gene drift eliminates the variation made by mutation. Gene drift can make the population to lost most of mutations, which can be explained by the random sampling of a finite population, since finite populations are unlikely to sample themselves perfectly from one generation to the next due to probability error. Eventually, the mutation and gene drift will reach its equilibrium and determine the variation level of a population.</p><h2 id=gene-flow>Gene flow<a href=#gene-flow class=header-anchor arialabel=Anchor> #</a></h2><p>Gene flow is the exchange of genes between populations. Gene flow can homogenize populations by sharing variation between populations and, like ocean waves, it can make gene move from population to population across geographic distance without individual moving across distance, across long periods of time.</p><h2 id=natural-selection>Natural selection<a href=#natural-selection class=header-anchor arialabel=Anchor> #</a></h2><p>Natural selection is the most misleading concept among all. Natural selection shapes phenotype (characteristics we can observe) and then indirectly influences genotype (unobservable gene package). It is partially directional as it increases the frequency of phenotype that is of higher fitness. A vivid example of natural selection could be lactose tolerance. Lactose tolerance can happen at any random time, nevertheless, there is no reason that it is favored until the domestication of animals. So this mutation could just lost before the production of milk and could only persist after more and more people start drink milk. However, natural selection is <strong>not synonymous with evolution and is only one force of evolutionary change!</strong> If we have a look at a fog in the forest, we should bare in mind that not every characteristic of this fog is an adaption or selected for. Instead, they are more likely to be the result of mutation/ gene flow/ gene drift.</p><p>In a nutshell, mutation, gene drift and gene flow are all random, while natural selection is kind of directional. The evolution is the outcome of these four forces and it more like a random walk. Further, I also want to point out that there is also survivor bias when we interpret “THE PATH” of evaluation. As we are more likely to observe populations that survive, we tend to neglect those who go extinct and fail to see the various possibility that evolution brings.</p><p>{<figure src="https://hellenshengfy.github.io/Cover pic.jpg" title="Hand-drawing of my understanding of evolution" width=200>}}</p><p>References:
