</code></pre><p>Location: A large tell site (13 hectares) in Central Anatolia.</p><p>Two mounds, of which : 34 acre East mound Neolithic</p><p>Archaeologist:
1960s. James Mellaart | 70% cattle bones. Biased （hand collection instead of sieves)
1993 Ian Hodder | cattle constitute 20-25% of the faunal assemblage, and there is no indication of domestication.</p><p>Date: 7 400-6 200 cal. BC. 7100-6000BC</p><p>Peak Population : 3500-8000</p><p>Secular Life:
1. Crop agriculture| Hunting| Herding|
dwell in mudbrick house and access through roof
Community —-small group
2. Food:
Domesticated animal (sheep and goat) as main meat supply??? Or COW?
Cereal/legume/diary/ wild animals
3. Deforestation
4. Trade (bear paw)
5. Burial: Most indoor, very few outdoors, Some secondary burial
Spiritual life:
1. Taboo: bird/pig/deer/leopard
2. Religious/feasting : Wild animal (bull and bird) as religious symbol and feasting (bull)</p><p>a combination of crop agriculture, caprine herding, intensive gathering, and hunting.
Villagers dwelt in mudbrick houses built so close together that occupants accessed them through their roofs.
Evidence of complex mortuary ceremonialism, and possibly deliberate incineration of buildings.
no specialized shrines or temples at the site.</p><p>cattle horns are incorporated into buildings in ways that leave them invisible. These occurrences, as well as the abandonment deposits, suggest that cattle horns were not just trophies for
display: they had non-display significance as well.</p><p>大遗存报告</p><p>Domesticated:
◎ Sheep and goat (Sheep: of confidence; goat: most likely; these animals were consuming very similar foods to each other and were all confined to the same or similar environments with no access to C4 plants. At Catalho ̈ yu ̈ k, the results show how the caprine management strategy develops from the strategy seen at Axsıklı Ho ̈yu ̈k into a more varied practice at an early stage as the site grows with an increasing dietary contribution obtained from C4 plants. )</p><p>• Main meat supply
—Numerically dominated in animal bones. ——Penned
— slaughtered as juveniles or subadults
— wool / dairy products of little importance.
—Pattern : domestic activities (highly processed (smashed & boiled for grease) , inhouse oven)</p><p>DOUBT! The evidence from bones and isotopes is somewhat in conflict as to how much they contributed to the meat diet.</p><p>• Absent in symbolic context
• The only deliberate animal interment at Çatalhöyük: One year female (probably) sheep<br>—Lamb as pet ?? awkward burial position means the avoidance of contact of the animal
—Indicate the man is shepherd ?? sheep herding very common, most Çatalhöyük grave goods appear to be personal possessions
— Spiritual guidance ?? sheep do not appear to have been of major symbolic significance at Çatalhöyük.</p><p>◎ Dog</p><p>Wild （symbolic) :</p><p>◎ Cattle (Special context) :
Both the special and the non-special groups emphasized mature animals and males; biases toward large animals and right-hand-side horn cores were also apparent.</p><p>• Installations</p><p>core symbol of the Neolithic Near East. cattle horns were concealed in or under walls, floors, and benches</p><p>Cattle horn: Famous for architectural installations. Mellaart recorded three variants:</p><ol><li>frontlets (horn cores and the intervening skull) set in plaster heads attached to walls;</li><li>frontlets set in small pillars along the edges of platforms;</li><li>pairs of horns set into benches.</li></ol><p>Three morphological types apparent in the Çatalhöyük horn core assemblage:
Type 1 thought to be male Bos primigenius (wild cattle, or aurochs) ;
Type 2 represents a variant male aurochs;
Type 3 female .</p><p>• Feasting spreads</p><p>— Pattern: Feasting remaining<br>large intact joint, not smashed, processed for marrow but not bone grease, likely to be roasted in open area
Its important to find out whether the bull is wild or nor because its relates to hunting ritual if wild</p><pre><code>               Not herded! Size fall in the range of wild
</code></pre><p>several cattle horns and crania have been found in midden deposits. These may simply be butchery waste, but some occur in bone concentrations, suggesting that they are dismantled installations or part of feasting deposits.</p><p>A pronounced majority of the horn cores come from males (table 5). 71% male/probably male specimens</p><p>An increasing in female and subadults in phase threee : community wide ceremonies to the appearance of smaller group ceremonies</p><p>• Caches</p><p>◎ Bird
rare in feasting deposit</p><p>Over representation of wings</p><p>A few appear in burial: burial of newborns</p><p>• Cranes: in dancing postures</p><p>• vultures swooping at headless human figures : carrying soul to the heaven</p><p>◎ Pig
maybe taboo in later levels: forbidden to certain groups of people/ not allowed to be eaten on site
◎ Deer
Appear prominently in wall paintings of later period: symbolic importance</p><p>maybe taboo in later levels: forbidden to certain groups of people/ not allowed to be eaten on site</p><p>◎ Fox
◎ Badger
◎ Wolf
◎ Hare</p><p>◎ One wild large horse ( wild horses were thought to be extinct in Anatolia in Neolithic time )
Three species identified___ a relic population survived at least in central Anatolia well into Holocene
◎ Dear decreasing though the time —deforestation in the area
◎ Brown bear — trade (brown bear live in mountain areas)</p><p>Burial:<br>• Most indoor, very few outdoors, Some secondary burial
• Most burials are contracted and lie on the right or left side, but there is no standard orientation or arrangement of the body.
• many burials contain no grave goods, whereas others contain rich assemblage
• Very few animal involved : 2 cattle horn and 1 sheep, some birds……</p><p style=color:#777>Last modified on 2023-05-13</p></div><a href=#top><i class="fa fa-chevron-up" style=font-size:30px;color:#000></i></a></main><footer class=footer><script type=text/javascript src=/js/math-code.js></script><script async src="//mathjax.rstudio.com/latest/MathJax.js?config=TeX-MML-AM_CHTML"></script><script type=text/javascript src=/js/center-img.js></script><ul class=footer-links><li><a href=/en/posts/index.xml type=application/rss+xml title="RSS feed">Subscribe</a></li><li><a href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/ target=_blank>License
